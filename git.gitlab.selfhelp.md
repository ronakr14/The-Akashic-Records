## 📌 Topic Overview

**GitLab** is a complete DevOps platform featuring:

* Git repository hosting (public/private/self-hosted)
* Built-in CI/CD pipelines with powerful YAML configs
* Issue tracking, boards, milestones, and epics
* Code review and merge requests (MRs)
* Container registry & package registry
* Security scanning, monitoring, and compliance tools
* Kubernetes integration and Auto DevOps
* Self-managed or cloud SaaS options

Why GitLab?
Because it’s the “single pane of glass” that aligns dev, ops, and security teams seamlessly.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔹 Basic `.gitlab-ci.yml` example

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Building the app"
    - make build

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "Running tests"
    - make test

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "Deploying"
    - ./deploy.sh
  only:
    - main
```

### 🔹 Protected Branch Setup (CLI snippet)

```bash
curl --request POST --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: <token>" \
  "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/protected_branches?name=main"
```
