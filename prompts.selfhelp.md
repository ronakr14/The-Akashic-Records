**1. Teach me what I’ve ignored for too long**
**Prompt:**
*Based on what most high performers or successful people wish they had learned earlier in life, create a custom list of 10 critical skills, ideas, or mental models I’ve likely been blind to. Then explain why each one matters in ways I’ve probably underestimated.*

**2. Collapse a year of wisdom into an hour**
**Prompt:**
*You are my personal mentor. Compress the most important lessons from psychology, philosophy, and real-world experience into one power-packed learning session. No fluff—just the raw ideas that shift how I see myself and the world.*

---

**3. Show me what school never did**
**Prompt:**
*Ignore traditional education. Based on where I am in life, give me a personal curriculum that teaches me how to think clearly, act strategically, communicate persuasively, and adapt faster than my environment. Include the real-world “why” behind each lesson.*
