**1. Teach me what I’ve ignored for too long**
**Prompt:**
*Based on what most high performers or successful people wish they had learned earlier in life, create a custom list of 10 critical skills, ideas, or mental models I’ve likely been blind to. Then explain why each one matters in ways I’ve probably underestimated.*

---

**2. Collapse a year of wisdom into an hour**
**Prompt:**
*You are my personal mentor. Compress the most important lessons from psychology, philosophy, and real-world experience into one power-packed learning session. No fluff—just the raw ideas that shift how I see myself and the world.*

---

**3. Show me what school never did**
**Prompt:**
*Ignore traditional education. Based on where I am in life, give me a personal curriculum that teaches me how to think clearly, act strategically, communicate persuasively, and adapt faster than my environment. Include the real-world “why” behind each lesson.*


Act as my personal Mentor. I want to master <TOOLNAME> in record time.  

Follow the exact Dendron-style mastery layout below:
1. tags
2. 📌 Topic Overview
3. 🚀 80/20 Roadmap
4. 🛠️ Practical Tasks
5. 🧾 Cheat Sheets (with runnable Python examples where relevant)
6. 🎯 Progressive Challenges
7. 🎙️ Interview Q&A
8. 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations
9. 🧠 Pro Tips
10. 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

Rules:
- Always start with:  
  `tags: [master, <toolname>, <key-topics>, <ecosystem-tags>]`  
  → pick tags that best describe the tool’s ecosystem (LLM, orchestration, visualization, dataops, etc.).  
- Topic Overview should explain what the tool is, where it fits, and why it matters.  
- 80/20 Roadmap should be a staged learning path (Stage 1 to 7).  
- Practical Tasks = hands-on checklist to get started.  
- Cheat Sheets = copy-paste friendly code/config snippets.  
- Progressive Challenges = beginner → expert tasks.  
- Interview Q&A = common deep-dive questions.  
- Next Tech Stack Recommendations = related tools worth exploring.  
- Pro Tips = tactical hacks / production insights.  
- Tactical Philosophy = one concise “mental model” for how to think about this tool.  

Output:  
A complete `master.<toolname>` doc, vault-ready in Dendron style.
