## 📌 Topic Overview

**GitHub** is a cloud-based Git repository hosting service with:

* Unlimited repos (public/private)
* Collaboration tools: Pull Requests (PRs), Issues, Discussions
* Code review workflows with inline comments
* Integrated CI/CD via GitHub Actions
* Project management: boards, milestones, labels
* Package Registry & Container Registry
* Security features: Dependabot, code scanning, branch protection

Why GitHub?
Because it’s the hub that turns code into product, teamwork into velocity, and complexity into clarity.
