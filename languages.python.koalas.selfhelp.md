## 📌 Topic Overview

**Koalas** bridges the gap between the simplicity of **Pandas** and the power of **Apache Spark**. Developed by Databricks (now merged into **pyspark.pandas**), Koalas lets you write **Pandas-like code** that runs on **Spark clusters**, making it ideal for big data workflows.

Think of it as Pandas with superpowers — capable of scaling to terabytes without rewriting everything in Spark syntax. If you know Pandas and need to go big, Koalas is your ticket to the distributed data party.

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

- ✅ Create a Koalas DataFrame from CSV  
- ✅ Filter and sort data using `.loc[]`, `.query()`  
- ✅ Group by a column and aggregate  
- ✅ Join two DataFrames on a key  
- ✅ Convert Koalas → Pandas and back  
- ✅ Use `apply()` with user-defined functions  
- ✅ Write output as Delta format to S3  
- ✅ Handle nulls, renaming, and data typing at scale  
- ✅ Run `.info()` and `.describe()` like Pandas  
- ✅ Use SQL syntax via SparkSQL on top of Koalas data

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🐨 Create & Convert

```python
import pyspark.pandas as ps  # Koalas is now here

df = ps.read_csv("large_data.csv")
df = ps.DataFrame({"id": [1, 2], "name": ["Alice", "Bob"]})

pdf = df.to_pandas()
df_back = ps.from_pandas(pdf)
````

### 📊 Filtering & Selection

```python
df[df["age"] > 25]
df.loc[df["status"] == "active", ["name", "salary"]]
df.query("salary > 100000 & city == 'Bangalore'")
```

### 🔄 Aggregation & GroupBy

```python
df.groupby("department")["salary"].mean()
df.groupby(["region", "status"]).agg({"score": "max"})
```

### 🔗 Joins & Merge

```python
ps.merge(df1, df2, on="emp_id", how="inner")
```

### 🔬 UDFs & Apply

```python
df["tax"] = df["salary"].apply(lambda x: x * 0.1)
```

> For heavy UDFs, use `map_in_pandas()` with caution to avoid Spark shuffle hell.

### 📤 Save Output

```python
df.to_parquet("/mnt/data/output.parquet")
df.to_delta("/mnt/delta/sales_data")
```

## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** What is the difference between Pandas and Koalas under the hood?
* **Q:** How does Koalas handle memory and distributed execution?
* **Q:** Can you use Pandas UDFs with Koalas? When should you avoid them?
* **Q:** What happens when you call `.to_pandas()` on a massive DataFrame?
* **Q:** When should you **not** use Koalas?

---

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **pyspark.sql** — Native Spark APIs when you outgrow Koalas' Pandas-style
* **Delta Lake** — Versioned storage layer perfect for Koalas write workflows
* **Dask** — In-memory parallel Pandas on single-machine clusters
* **Polars** — For ultra-fast DataFrame operations on smaller data
* **Databricks Notebooks** — Seamless Koalas integration in real-world data lakes

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Avoid `.apply()` for heavy functions — use Spark native or vectorized UDFs
* Use `df.spark.cache()` to persist in-memory for reuse
* Always call `.compute()` before benchmarking performance
* Don’t expect Pandas-level interactivity; this is Spark-scale
* Use `.to_pandas()` **only when you’re sure the result fits in RAM**

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

> “Koalas gives you the language of Pandas with the firepower of Spark.”

🪄 Treat it as your **bridge** from local dev to scalable big data
🚀 Write once, run anywhere — from laptop to distributed cluster
📊 Great for **prototyping at scale** without PySpark boilerplate
⚠️ But always know where Koalas ends and Spark begins
