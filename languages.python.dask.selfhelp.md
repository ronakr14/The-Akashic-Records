## 📌 Topic Overview

**Dask** is the Python powerhouse for **scalable, parallel computing** on datasets that won’t fit in your laptop’s RAM — or that need to run faster by using multiple CPU cores or even clusters.

It’s built to extend familiar PyData APIs like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **scikit-learn** into **distributed, out-of-core** computing, so you don’t have to rewrite your code or learn a new language.

Dask handles **task scheduling, chunking, and parallelism** under the hood, making it a Swiss Army knife for data engineers, scientists, and analysts facing big data headaches.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🐍 Dask DataFrame Basics

```python
import dask.dataframe as dd

df = dd.read_csv('large_data_*.csv')
filtered = df[df['age'] > 30]
result = filtered.groupby('department')['salary'].mean().compute()
````

### 🔄 Delayed Execution

```python
from dask import delayed

@delayed
def inc(x):
    return x + 1

@delayed
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

x = inc(10)
y = inc(20)
total = add(x, y)
print(total.compute())
```

### 💻 Distributed Client

```python
from dask.distributed import Client

client = Client()
print(client)
```

### 🔍 Diagnostics Dashboard

* Access at `http://localhost:8787/status` when running a Distributed Client
* Visualize task graphs with `result.visualize()`

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Persist intermediate results to avoid recomputation (`df.persist()`)
* Avoid very small or very large chunk sizes — balance IO & parallelism
* Use the dashboard to catch task stragglers and memory leaks early
* Prefer Dask DataFrame APIs over `dask.delayed` for easier scaling
* Clean up unused futures with `client.cancel()` to free memory
