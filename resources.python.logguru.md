## 📌 Topic Overview

**LogGuru** is:

* An advanced, intelligent **log management and analysis tool** designed to simplify log monitoring, troubleshooting, and insights.
* Typically powered by AI/ML to detect anomalies, extract patterns, and generate actionable alerts from large volumes of log data.
* Enables correlation across distributed systems, microservices, and complex infrastructures.
* Supports structured and unstructured logs with integrations to popular logging frameworks.
* Features include:
  * **Automated anomaly detection** and root cause analysis.
  * Intuitive dashboards and visualizations.
  * Custom alerting based on patterns and thresholds.
  * Integration with existing monitoring and alerting tools.
  * Scalable ingestion and indexing for high-throughput environments.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔹 Basic Log Query Example

```

error OR exception
\| where timestamp > now() - 1h
\| stats count() by source, level
\| sort desc by count

```

### 🔹 Setting Alert on Error Spike

- Define a threshold on error count increase over baseline.  
- Set notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty).  
- Configure alert severity and escalation policy.

### 🔹 Common Log Parsing Patterns

- Regex to extract timestamps, log levels, message content.  
- JSON parsing for structured logs.  
- Field enrichment with host, application, and environment tags.
