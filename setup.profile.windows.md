## üöÄ Steps to Auto-Run Commands in PowerShell Terminal

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Check if You Have a Profile File**

```powershell
Test-Path $PROFILE
```

* **If it returns `False`**, create it:

```powershell
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -ItemType File -Force
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Edit Your Profile File**

This is where you add your startup commands.

```powershell
notepad $PROFILE
```

Add your commands in this file. Example:

```powershell
# Example commands
Set-Location C:\Projects\DefaultFolder
Import-Module posh-git
Write-Host "Ready to code, boss!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Save and Restart PowerShell**

Every new terminal session will now execute whatever you placed inside `$PROFILE`.

---

## ‚ö° Pro Tip: Multiple Profiles

PowerShell distinguishes between:

* **Current User / Current Host** (`$PROFILE`)
* **All Users / Current Host** (`$PROFILE.AllUsersCurrentHost`)
* **Current User / All Hosts** (`$PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts`)
* **All Users / All Hosts** (`$PROFILE.AllUsersAllHosts`)

You likely only need:

```powershell
$PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost
```

But for enterprise-wide configs, administrators can target the "All Users" profiles.

## üõë Important Gotcha: Execution Policy

If scripts aren't running due to policy restrictions:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

If it's `Restricted`, loosen it (only if you trust your environment):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Example Use Case

Auto-connect to Azure, Git, or AWS CLI profiles, preload virtual environments, or set working directories‚Äîall automated.
