## 📌 Topic Overview

**TensorFlow** is Google's flagship open-source library for building and deploying machine learning and deep learning models. It’s the Swiss Army knife of AI — supporting everything from quick prototyping with eager execution to large-scale distributed training and production-grade deployment.

TensorFlow’s **flexibility** spans from building custom neural networks to running pre-trained models in edge devices. Thanks to its tight integration with Keras (the high-level API), it balances ease of use and advanced capabilities, powering research breakthroughs and production systems alike.

> 🔥 Industry standard for deep learning  
> ⚙️ Supports CPUs, GPUs, TPUs  
> 🔄 Dynamic eager and static graph execution  
> 🚀 Production-ready with TensorFlow Serving & Lite

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔢 Tensor Basics

```python
import tensorflow as tf

a = tf.constant([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
b = tf.Variable(tf.random.normal([2, 2]))
c = tf.matmul(a, b)
````

### 🏗️ Keras Model

```python
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_dim,)),
    layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)
```

### 🔄 Data Pipeline

```python
dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((features, labels))
dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=1000).batch(32).prefetch(tf.data.AUTOTUNE)
```

### 🎯 Callbacks

```python
callbacks = [
    tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=3),
    tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint('model.h5', save_best_only=True)
]
model.fit(dataset, epochs=50, callbacks=callbacks)
```

### 💾 Save & Load

```python
model.save('saved_model_path')
new_model = tf.keras.models.load_model('saved_model_path')
```

### 🧩 Custom Layer Example

```python
class MyLayer(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
    def __init__(self, units=32):
        super().__init__()
        self.units = units

    def build(self, input_shape):
        self.w = self.add_weight(shape=(input_shape[-1], self.units), initializer='random_normal')

    def call(self, inputs):
        return tf.matmul(inputs, self.w)
```

### 🖥️ Distributed Training

```python
strategy = tf.distribute.MirroredStrategy()
with strategy.scope():
    model = create_model()
    model.compile(...)
    model.fit(...)
```
