```

- Create New Page:

    All pages should be in markdown language and formatting.<br>
    For Markdown guidelines, visit: [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)<br>
    Create a new file under docs folder with a 'md' extension.<br>
    These files can be nested and grouped under folders.<br>
    Once file is created, you can add the link of this file in docs/index.md using `[Name](new_page.md)`<br>
    This file can be added in mkdocs.yml under nav to display in navigation bar in website with following structure:
    ```
    Name: new_page.md
    ```

- View Draft:

    To check how your website looks, run:
    ```
    mkdocs serve
    ```
    This will render your website in runtime, so any changes you do in your pages will get reflect here.<br>
    This will help in modify/add contents to your website.

- Build your website:

    Once you are satisfied on how your website looks, its time to build the website.<br>
    Run the following command to build:
    ```
    mkdocs build
    ```
    This will create a new folder named as 'Site' which will contain details and contents to build a static pages.<br>
    These content can be used anywhere to build your website.

- Deployment

    Once mkdocs build command gets complete, add your contents to github repository.<br>
    Initialize a git repository within the project folder.<br>
    Create a gitignore file and add site folder in it. This will avoid having duplicate content in github repository.<br>
    Now, add all the contents in git and commit it.<br>
    Create a github repository with the same project name and push your folder contents to it.<br>
    Now its time to deploy your website using github pages.<br>
    Run the following command:
    ```
    mkdocs gh-deploy
    ```
    This will create a gh_pages branch and push the content of site to it and run the github workflow for deployment.<br>
    After some time, your website will be deployed at the website link which will be provided when you run the mkdocs deploy command.
