## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q1:** What makes Material for MkDocs better than plain MkDocs?

  * Material adds built-in UX enhancements (search, tabs, dark mode, responsive design), over 50+ features, and reduces custom CSS/JS work drastically.

* **Q2:** How do you handle multi-version docs in Material?

  * Use `mike` plugin for versioning, integrated with Material’s version selector. It keeps multiple versions live, with automatic dropdowns.

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **Docusaurus** → If you want React components inside docs.
* **Hugo + Docsy theme** → Ultra-fast static docs alternative.
* **ReadTheDocs + Sphinx** → If auto-generating API docs is your focus.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use **extra.css/extra.js** only when necessary; Material covers 90% of UI needs.
* Use **icons (Material Icons/FontAwesome)** to make nav intuitive.
* Configure **search index in multiple languages** if docs are global.
* Keep **palette minimal** — too many colors look amateur.

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

Documentation should feel like a **product, not an afterthought**. Material gives you a UI that builds trust with users and contributors. Treat every doc update as a **feature release**: design it, ship it, and version it.
