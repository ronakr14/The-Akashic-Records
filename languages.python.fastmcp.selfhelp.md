## 📌 Topic Overview

**FastMCP** (Fast Modular Control Plane) is a **lightweight orchestration layer** for managing AI agents, tools, memory, and chains — inspired by [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) but designed to be simpler, faster, and modular from the ground up.

It acts as a **fast, reactive middleware** to wire up LLMs, actions, user input, memory, toolchains, and agent state transitions in a maintainable and testable way.

> FastMCP is like a *"backend framework for autonomous agents"* — no vendor lock-in, no magic, just Python + logic.

## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Focus Area                 | Why It Matters                                                |
|-------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | MCP Core Concepts          | Understand nodes, edges, contexts, transitions                 |
| 2️⃣    | Define State Schema        | All logic flows from knowing the shape of your agent state     |
| 3️⃣    | Build Node Functions       | Nodes = discrete agent capabilities (LLM, tools, memory, etc.) |
| 4️⃣    | Edge Map & Transitions     | Define logic to move between states based on outcomes          |
| 5️⃣    | Run Executor               | Wire it all up with the `Executor.run()` loop                  |
| 6️⃣    | Tool Integration           | Use tools (like APIs or calculators) inside nodes              |
| 7️⃣    | Multi-Agent Coordination   | Model conversations or workflows across multiple agents        |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

- ✅ Define an initial `State` Pydantic schema with fields like `user_input`, `history`, `tool_output`
- ✅ Create a node that calls OpenAI or Mistral and stores output
- ✅ Build an edge map function to transition states (e.g. "if tool not called → call tool")
- ✅ Implement a memory node that updates conversation context
- ✅ Run a complete control loop using `Executor.run(state)`
- ✅ Log all transitions using `print()` or a logger inside node functions
- ✅ Extend with new tools by injecting into the state and node logic
- ✅ Add fallback logic for retries or exceptions inside nodes

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔹 State Schema

```python
class State(BaseModel):
    user_input: str
    history: List[str] = []
    llm_output: Optional[str] = None
    tool_output: Optional[str] = None
````

### 🔹 Node Function

```python
def llm_node(state: State) -> State:
    response = openai_chat(state.user_input)
    state.llm_output = response
    return state
```

### 🔹 Edge Map (Transition Logic)

```python
def edge_map(state: State) -> str:
    if state.llm_output and not state.tool_output:
        return "tool_call"
    return "end"
```

### 🔹 Execution Loop

```python
executor = Executor(
    nodes={"llm_node": llm_node, "tool_call": tool_node},
    edges=edge_map,
    entry_point="llm_node"
)

final_state = executor.run(State(user_input="What's the weather in NYC?"))
```

## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** What is FastMCP and how is it different from LangChain?
* **Q:** How would you model an LLM → Tool → Memory loop?
* **Q:** What’s the role of the `edge_map()` function?
* **Q:** How do you manage state and prevent infinite loops?

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **LangGraph** — Visual, typed graph orchestration with built-in persistence
* **Haystack Agents** — For RAG-focused use cases
* **OpenDevin / AutoGPT** — Full-blown agent frameworks with FastMCP-style modularity
* **Celery + Redis** — For queuing and distributed orchestration
* **Streamlit or FastAPI** — Build quick UIs or APIs to wrap your agent logic

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use **type-safe `State` schemas** to catch bugs at design time
* Make nodes **pure functions** that only transform `State` — easier to test
* Add `print(state)` inside edges to debug transitions
* Use `retry`, `timeout`, or `circuit breaker` logic inside critical nodes
* Modularize agent behavior into **reusable strategies** (e.g. "get info", "decide", "act")

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

> **“FastMCP is like a control tower for your agents — not the pilot, not the plane, but the air traffic system that routes, validates, and dispatches actions.”**

🧱 Keep nodes dumb but composable
🔀 Transitions = business logic in motion
📦 State = single source of truth
🕹️ Executor = orchestrator that follows rules
🧪 Test every node with mocked states
