## 📌 Topic Overview

**SQLite** is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine embedded directly into applications. It’s the most widely deployed database engine in the world — used in mobile apps, browsers, IoT devices, and small-scale server-side projects.

It’s designed for **simplicity**, **zero-configuration**, and **high performance** in local storage scenarios. It supports most SQL features (joins, transactions, indexes), and stores everything in a **single `.sqlite` file**.

| Stage | Concept                        | Why It Matters                                         |
|-------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | `.sqlite` File Storage         | Understand how SQLite is file-based and self-contained |
| 2️⃣    | SQL Basics (DDL/DML)           | Create, read, update, delete data                      |
| 3️⃣    | Indexing & Query Tuning        | Speed up queries with lightweight indexing             |
| 4️⃣    | Transactions & ACID            | Safe updates and rollback handling                     |
| 5️⃣    | Python + `sqlite3` Module      | Programmatic usage in apps and scripts                 |
| 6️⃣    | CLI Tool Usage                 | Execute scripts, inspect schema, and debug via CLI     |
| 7️⃣    | Data Import/Export             | Move data between CSV, JSON, or other SQLite DBs       |
| 8️⃣    | Views & Triggers               | Encapsulate logic and enforce integrity rules          |
| 9️⃣    | SQLite Extensions              | Add FTS5 (full-text search), JSON1, Spatial support    |
| 🔟     | WAL Mode & Performance Tuning  | Improve concurrency and write performance              |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

- ✅ Create a `.sqlite` database file using the CLI  
- ✅ Create tables with primary keys and constraints  
- ✅ Insert and query data using joins and filters  
- ✅ Create indexes and measure performance gains  
- ✅ Use transactions to batch operations safely  
- ✅ Build a simple Python script to read/write from DB  
- ✅ Use the SQLite CLI to dump/restore a DB  
- ✅ Create triggers for logging or constraints  
- ✅ Enable WAL mode for high write concurrency  
- ✅ Use `.import` to load data from a CSV

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🏗️ Create and Use Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('Alice', 'alice@example.com');
SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com';
````

### 🧠 Indexes & Views

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);

CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active';
```

### 🧪 Transactions

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE users SET name = 'Bob' WHERE id = 1;
DELETE FROM sessions WHERE user_id = 1;
COMMIT;
-- or ROLLBACK;
```

### 🐍 Python Integration

```python
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect("mydb.sqlite")
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (1,))
rows = cursor.fetchall()
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

## 🎯 Progressive Challenges

| Level           | Challenge                                                               |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🥉 Beginner     | Create a DB with 2–3 related tables, insert data, query with joins      |
| 🥈 Intermediate | Add indexes and measure query improvement with `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN`     |
| 🥇 Advanced     | Build a CLI tool in Python that logs data to SQLite and supports search |
| 🏆 Expert       | Use FTS5 to implement a full-text search over a documents table         |

## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** What makes SQLite different from other databases like Postgres or MySQL?
* **Q:** How does SQLite ensure data consistency across writes?
* **Q:** Can multiple processes access a SQLite DB? How does WAL mode help?
* **Q:** How do you integrate SQLite in a Python/Flask application?
* **Q:** What are some limitations of SQLite in a production environment?

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **SQLAlchemy Core + SQLite** — powerful query builder with SQLite support
* **Peewee ORM** — minimal ORM built specifically for SQLite apps
* **Datasette** — instant web API for SQLite files
* **DB Browser for SQLite** — GUI for inspecting and editing .sqlite files
* **pandas + SQLite** — analysis-ready workflows with local data

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Enable **WAL mode** for higher concurrency: `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;`
* Always parameterize your queries to avoid SQL injection
* Use **`VACUUM`** occasionally to compact the DB and reclaim space
* Store small images/files using **BLOBs**, or large ones as file paths
* Avoid complex joins or recursive queries — keep it lightweight
* Use **`.mode csv`** and `.import`/`.export` for fast CLI-based data load

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

> “SQLite is like the Swiss army knife of databases — small, reliable, and always ready.”

⚡ Think of it as a **local JSON replacement** with real SQL power
🧩 Perfect for embedded systems, notebooks, small-scale ETL, and mobile
📦 Keep DBs small and focused; don’t try to mimic enterprise RDBMS
🔄 Favor append-only tables and log-based updates when scaling
🛠 Combine with tools like Pandas, dbt, or even Airflow for local dev pipelines
