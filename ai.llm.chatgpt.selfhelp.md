## 📌 Topic Overview

**ChatGPT** is:

* An API-accessible LLM from OpenAI.
* Powers chatbots, assistants, content generators, and reasoning engines.
* Supports **system prompts**, **multi-turn conversations**, and **function calling**.
* **GPT-4-turbo** (2024+) models are fast, cost-effective, and context-aware.

Why it matters:

* ChatGPT is more than chat. It’s an **LLM-as-a-service** backend.
* You’re building apps? This is your cognitive engine.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **Basic Chat Completion (Python)**:

```python
import openai

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-4-turbo",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a professional SQL assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a SQL query to fetch top 5 customers."}
  ]
)
print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

* **Function Calling Example**:

```python
functions = [
  {
    "name": "get_weather",
    "description": "Get weather info.",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "location": {"type": "string"}
      },
      "required": ["location"]
    }
  }
]

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-4-turbo",
  messages=[...],
  functions=functions
)
```

* **Streaming Responses**:

```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
  model="gpt-4-turbo",
  messages=[...],
  stream=True
)
for chunk in response:
    print(chunk['choices'][0]['delta'].get('content', ''), end='')
```

## 🎩 Pro Ops Tips

* Keep system prompts short but powerful—think of them as your model’s job description.
* Use **function calling** to turn GPT into your backend’s decision maker.
* Use **streaming** for smoother UX in chatbots or content generators.
* Monitor token usage—streamlined prompts save costs.
* For regulated environments? Consider swapping to **local LLaMA + Ollama** for data privacy.

## ⚔️ Tactical Philosophy

**ChatGPT isn’t just a chatbot. It’s an orchestration engine, API controller, and content generator.**

Think microservices. Treat prompts like API contracts. Build AI systems, not scripts.
