## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Focus Area                        | Why It Matters                                                                |
| ----- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Installation & Basics             | Get MkDocs running locally, generate docs from Markdown.                      |
| 2     | Theming (Material for MkDocs)     | 80% of devs use it; gives modern UI, search, nav, and branding.               |
| 3     | Config mastery (`mkdocs.yml`)     | Controls nav, plugins, themes; the heart of customization.                    |
| 4     | Plugins & Extensions              | Superpowers like versioning, mermaid diagrams, i18n, GitHub pages deployment. |
| 5     | Deployment (CI/CD + GitHub Pages) | Puts docs live in one command; automation keeps docs in sync with code.       |
| 6     | Scaling docs (large repos)        | Best practices for structuring docs across teams/projects.                    |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

* ✅ Install MkDocs (`pip install mkdocs`) and run `mkdocs serve`.
* ✅ Scaffold a project with `mkdocs new my-docs`.
* ✅ Add **Material for MkDocs** theme.
* ✅ Configure navigation in `mkdocs.yml`.
* ✅ Add plugins: `search`, `mkdocs-material-extensions`, `git-revision-date-localized`.
* ✅ Deploy to GitHub Pages with `mkdocs gh-deploy`.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **Core CLI**

  * `mkdocs new [dir]` → Create new site
  * `mkdocs serve` → Local dev server
  * `mkdocs build` → Generate static site
  * `mkdocs gh-deploy` → Push to GitHub Pages

* **mkdocs.yml essentials**

  ```yaml
  site_name: My Project Docs
  theme:
    name: material
  nav:
    - Home: index.md
    - Guide:
        - Intro: guide/intro.md
        - API: guide/api.md
  plugins:
    - search
    - git-revision-date-localized
  ```

* **Best Plugins**

  * `mkdocs-material` → UI
  * `mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin` → Diagrams
  * `mkdocs-git-authors-plugin` → Contributor info
  * `mkdocs-minify-plugin` → Optimize build

## 🎯 Progressive Challenges

| Level           | Task                                                                                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🥉 Beginner     | Build a personal documentation site with MkDocs default theme.                                |
| 🥈 Intermediate | Add **Material theme**, configure custom nav + logo.                                          |
| 🥇 Advanced     | Use plugins for versioned docs (e.g., `mike`) and diagram support.                            |
| 🏆 Expert       | Automate CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) for multi-versioned docs with preview builds on PRs. |

## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q1:** Why choose MkDocs over Sphinx?

  * MkDocs is Markdown-first (simpler for devs), faster to set up, and has modern themes. Sphinx is reStructuredText-first, better for heavy academic/auto-generated API docs.

* **Q2:** How does MkDocs integrate with CI/CD?

  * Docs can be built automatically on every commit with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or any pipeline. The build artifacts (`site/`) can be pushed to GitHub Pages, S3, or any static hosting.

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **Docusaurus** → More React-driven, better for large OSS docs.
* **Hugo** → Ultra-fast static site generator, Markdown-native.
* **ReadTheDocs** → For Python-heavy, API-autodoc style projects.
* **mdBook** → Rust-based, great for lightweight docs/books.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Always **version your docs**—users will need old releases. Use `mike` plugin.
* Pair docs with **diagrams** (Mermaid, PlantUML) for clarity.
* Add **search and analytics** early; people will complain if they can’t find stuff.
* Treat docs like code: PR reviews, linting (e.g., `markdownlint`).

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

Documentation isn’t a *side project*—it’s a **scalable knowledge interface**. If code is the engine, docs are the *user manual* for both humans and future-you. A great MkDocs pipeline turns docs into a **living asset**, not a stale liability.
