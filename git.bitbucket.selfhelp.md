## 📌 Topic Overview

**Bitbucket** is a Git repository management solution with:

* Git and Mercurial support (Git preferred nowadays)
* Pull Requests (PR) for code review and collaboration
* Jira integration for issue and project tracking
* Pipelines for CI/CD automation (YAML-based)
* Branch permissions and merge checks
* Snippets, wikis, and code search
* Support for both cloud-hosted and self-managed (Bitbucket Server/Data Center)

Why Bitbucket?
Because it ties your code, issues, builds, and docs tightly together — all without leaving the Atlassian ecosystem.
