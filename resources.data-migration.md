## 📌 Topic Overview

**Data migration** is the process of transferring data between storage systems, databases, or formats—often during system upgrades, cloud adoption, schema changes, or application consolidation. A successful migration preserves data **integrity**, **availability**, and **performance** without disrupting business operations.

Whether you're migrating from PostgreSQL to Snowflake, on-premise to cloud, monolith to microservices—or even just changing table structures—data migration is a **mission-critical** operation that demands strategic planning, tooling, and fail-safes.

## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Concept                          | Why It Matters                                                |
|-------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | Source & Destination Mapping     | Define what data goes where (tables, schemas, fields)         |
| 2️⃣    | Schema Matching & DDL Scripts    | Map schema 1:1 or transform to new structures                 |
| 3️⃣    | ETL vs ELT Choice                | Choose method based on volume, compute location, complexity   |
| 4️⃣    | Data Extraction Techniques       | Efficiently extract from files, APIs, RDBMS, NoSQL            |
| 5️⃣    | Data Transformation Logic        | Handle format changes, field mappings, type casting           |
| 6️⃣    | Incremental Loads                | Avoid full reloads; use CDC or watermark-based deltas         |
| 7️⃣    | Load Strategies & Batch Design   | Insert, upsert, merge, bulk copy—choose wisely                |
| 8️⃣    | Validation & Reconciliation      | Ensure parity between source and destination                  |
| 9️⃣    | Rollback & Backup Plans          | Always plan for failure and recovery                          |
| 🔟    | Automation, Logging & Monitoring  | CI/CD + Observability for zero-downtime migrations            |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

- ✅ Perform source-to-target schema mapping document  
- ✅ Generate and review all DDLs for destination system  
- ✅ Extract sample data using Python, Bash, or a data tool  
- ✅ Create transform scripts (pandas, SQL, Spark, dbt, etc.)  
- ✅ Design incremental delta logic with timestamps/PKs  
- ✅ Write data loaders with batching, retry, and failover logic  
- ✅ Perform row/column count checks and hash checks post-migration  
- ✅ Setup rollback scripts or snapshot backups before cutover  
- ✅ Monitor load progress and log all metrics/errors  
- ✅ Perform post-migration audits and stakeholder sign-off

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔄 PostgreSQL → SQLite Migration Example

```bash
pg_dump -t public.my_table mydb | sqlite3 mydata.sqlite
````

### 📦 Pandas Data Migration (CSV → Snowflake)

```python
import pandas as pd
from snowflake.connector.pandas_tools import write_pandas

df = pd.read_csv("users.csv")

conn = snowflake.connector.connect(...)  # creds from .env
write_pandas(conn, df, 'USERS', schema='PUBLIC')
```

### 🧪 Validation Script

```python
src_count = pg_cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM source_table")
dst_count = sqlite_cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM target_table")

if src_count != dst_count:
    raise ValueError("Data mismatch detected!")
```

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **dbt** — For declarative data transformations and schema versioning
* **Airflow / Prefect** — For orchestrating multi-stage data migrations
* **Great Expectations** — Data validation and quality checks
* **Snowpipe / Fivetran** — Streaming/cloud-native migration

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use checksums, row counts, and sample queries for post-migration validation
* Always backup before writing to the destination
* Automate retry logic and build in idempotency
* Use versioned snapshots and time-based deltas for incremental migrations
* Separate migration logic from app logic—use staging environments

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

> “Migrations aren’t just copy-paste—they're surgical operations on your most valuable asset: your data.”

🎯 Focus on validation as much as transformation
⚙️ Automate everything: retries, logging, notifications
🔍 Be paranoid: assume corruption until verified
📈 Version everything: data, schema, configs
🧪 Build for testability: dry runs, mocks, and fake data
