# **Enterprise Multi-DB VIEW Operations Cheat Sheet**

| Operation                          | Purpose                                 | Basic Syntax                                                                | Notes / DB-Specific Details                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CREATE VIEW**                    | Define a virtual table based on a query | `sql CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name WHERE ...;` | Supported by all DBs. In Snowflake, Oracle, SQL Server, views can be **materialized** optionally.                                                                     |
| **CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW**       | Precompute & store results              | `sql CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_name AS SELECT ...;`                       | PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Snowflake support. SQLite does **not support materialized views** natively.                                                           |
| **ALTER VIEW**                     | Modify view definition                  | `sql ALTER VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...;`                                   | Not all DBs support `ALTER VIEW` to redefine query. Some require `DROP + CREATE`. PostgreSQL and SQL Server allow `ALTER VIEW`; SQLite requires `DROP VIEW + CREATE`. |
| **DROP VIEW**                      | Remove a view                           | `sql DROP VIEW view_name;`                                                  | Add `IF EXISTS` for safety: `DROP VIEW IF EXISTS view_name;`                                                                                                          |
| **REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW**      | Recompute stored results                | `sql REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_name;`                                    | PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, Snowflake. SQLite cannot refresh; recompute via `CREATE OR REPLACE`.                                                                  |
| **CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW**         | Safely redefine view                    | `sql CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...;`                       | Supported in PostgreSQL, Oracle, Snowflake, SQL Server. SQLite supports `CREATE VIEW` but not `OR REPLACE` until newer versions.                                      |
| **WITH CHECK OPTION**              | Ensure DML respects view filters        | `sql CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT ... WITH CHECK OPTION;`                        | Supported in PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server. Prevents inserts/updates violating view conditions.                                                                      |
| **Indexed / Materialized Columns** | Optimize performance                    | `sql CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_name CLUSTER BY (col);`                    | Snowflake: cluster keys. Oracle: indexes on materialized views. PostgreSQL: use `CREATE INDEX` on materialized view.                                                  |

## **Enterprise Design Notes**

* **SQLite:** Views are read-only by default; no materialized views; use `CREATE VIEW` + `INSERT INTO` for pseudo-materialization.
* **PostgreSQL:** Supports standard and materialized views; `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` required to update.
* **Snowflake:** Views always live; materialized views are storage-efficient for frequently accessed queries; refresh is automatic or manual.
* **Oracle:** Strong support for both standard and materialized views; supports query rewrite for optimizer; use `FAST REFRESH` if applicable.
* **SQL Server:** Supports indexed (materialized) views; must meet schema binding requirements; `ALTER VIEW` allowed.
* **Security & Permissions:** Grant `SELECT` privileges on views instead of base tables to enforce abstraction.
* **Best Practice:** Always alias columns explicitly and avoid `SELECT *` in views to prevent unexpected schema changes.
* **Use in ETL:** Views can act as abstraction layers; materialized views for performance-critical reporting.

## **Quick Examples**

```sql
-- Standard View
CREATE VIEW user_orders AS
SELECT u.id, u.username, o.amount
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

-- Materialized View (PostgreSQL / Oracle / Snowflake)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_user_orders AS
SELECT u.id, u.username, SUM(o.amount) AS total_amount
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.id, u.username;

-- Refresh Materialized View
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_user_orders;

-- Create or Replace View
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_orders AS
SELECT u.id, u.username, o.amount
FROM users u
JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id;

-- View with Check Option
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT * FROM users WHERE status='active'
WITH CHECK OPTION;
```
