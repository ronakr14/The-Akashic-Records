## 📌 Topic Overview

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the broad field of building machines that can **perceive, reason, learn, and act**. It spans everything from **rule-based expert systems** to today’s **deep learning and large language models (LLMs)**.

AI powers modern applications like:

* **Computer Vision** (image recognition, autonomous driving)
* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** (chatbots, translation, search)
* **Reinforcement Learning** (game-playing agents, robotics)
* **Generative AI** (text, images, code, music)
* **Decision Systems** (recommendations, fraud detection, predictive analytics)

Think of AI as the **umbrella**, with **Machine Learning (ML)** as its engine, and **Deep Learning** + **LLMs** as its current powerhouse.
