## 📌 Topic Overview

**Blockchain** is a decentralized, immutable ledger technology that records transactions across a distributed network of computers (nodes). It underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but its applications extend to supply chains, identity management, smart contracts, and more.

> Think of blockchain as a **tamper-proof, public spreadsheet** shared across thousands of participants — no single party controls it, yet everyone trusts the record.

Core concepts include **cryptographic hashing**, **consensus mechanisms**, **decentralization**, and **smart contracts** (programmable agreements).

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### ▶️ Basic Block Structure (Python)

```python
import hashlib
import time

class Block:
    def __init__(self, index, previous_hash, timestamp, data, nonce=0):
        self.index = index
        self.previous_hash = previous_hash
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.data = data
        self.nonce = nonce
        self.hash = self.calculate_hash()

    def calculate_hash(self):
        value = f"{self.index}{self.previous_hash}{self.timestamp}{self.data}{self.nonce}"
        return hashlib.sha256(value.encode()).hexdigest()
````

---

### ▶️ Proof of Work (Simplified)

```python
def proof_of_work(block, difficulty):
    block.nonce = 0
    while not block.hash.startswith('0' * difficulty):
        block.nonce += 1
        block.hash = block.calculate_hash()
    return block.hash
```

---

### ▶️ Ethereum Smart Contract (Solidity Example)

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleStorage {
    uint256 storedData;

    function set(uint256 x) public {
        storedData = x;
    }

    function get() public view returns (uint256) {
        return storedData;
    }
}
```

## 🔍 Mental Model

> “Blockchain is a **trustless, distributed ledger** that replaces centralized authority with cryptographic proof and collective consensus.”

* ✅ Data is immutable and transparent
* ✅ Decentralization reduces single points of failure and censorship
* ✅ Consensus mechanisms ensure agreement on state
* ✅ Smart contracts automate trusted logic without intermediaries
* ✅ Scalability and privacy remain key challenges for adoption
