## üìå Topic Overview

**Machine Learning (ML)** is about building systems that learn from data to make predictions or decisions, without being explicitly programmed. It powers:

* Recommendations (Netflix, Amazon)
* Fraud detection
* Predictive analytics
* Chatbots, search, autonomous systems

For you as a **data engineer**, ML mastery means:

* **Data wrangling** and **feature engineering**
* Understanding and deploying models
* Monitoring models in production
* Automating retraining pipelines (ML Ops)

In short: **ML = Data Engineering + Algorithms + DevOps**

## üßæ Cheat Sheets

* **Scikit-Learn Pipeline**:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('clf', RandomForestClassifier())
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = pipeline.predict(X_test)
```

* **Evaluation Metrics Quick Guide**:
  \| Task             | Metric             |
  \|------------------|--------------------|
  \| Classification   | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 |
  \| Imbalanced Data  | ROC AUC, Precision-Recall Curve |
  \| Regression       | MAE, RMSE, R¬≤ |

* **Model Serving (FastAPI)**:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
import joblib

app = FastAPI()
model = joblib.load("model.pkl")

@app.post("/predict/")
async def predict(data: dict):
    X = pd.DataFrame([data])
    pred = model.predict(X)[0]
    return {"prediction": pred}
```

* **MLflow Quick Start**:

```bash
mlflow ui
mlflow run .
mlflow models serve -m runs:/<run-id>/model
```
