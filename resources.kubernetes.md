## 📌 Topic Overview

**Kubernetes (K8s)** is a container orchestration platform. It automates:

* **Deployment**
* **Scaling**
* **Self-healing**
* **Networking**
* **Load balancing**
* **Secrets/config management**

It abstracts your infrastructure into **declarative manifests**. Developers focus on apps. K8s handles the rest.

Why K8s matters:

* Docker alone can’t manage 100s of services or dynamic scaling.
* It's **the backbone of modern cloud-native architecture.**
* AWS, Azure, GCP, and every startup swears by it.

## ⚡ 80/20 Roadmap

Skip unnecessary deep-dives. Master these tactical essentials:

| Stage  | Focus Area                                                   | Why?                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments                               | Core workload primitives.                         |
| **2**  | Services (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)                 | Handle internal/external traffic.                 |
| **3**  | ConfigMaps, Secrets                                          | Externalize configurations securely.              |
| **4**  | Volumes & PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)                      | State management for databases etc.               |
| **5**  | Namespaces                                                   | Environment isolation in multi-team clusters.     |
| **6**  | Ingress Controllers (NGINX, Traefik)                         | Route HTTP traffic via DNS.                       |
| **7**  | Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA)                             | Auto-scale based on CPU/memory.                   |
| **8**  | RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)                             | Secure multi-user access.                         |
| **9**  | Helm                                                         | Package manager to avoid YAML copy-paste madness. |
| **10** | Debugging Tools (`kubectl logs`, `kubectl exec`, `describe`) | Stay operationally sharp.                         |

## 🚀 Practical Tasks

| Task                                                                   | Description |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 🔥 Deploy a simple app using Deployment + Service.                     |             |
| 🔥 Expose the app externally via LoadBalancer or Ingress.              |             |
| 🔥 Store app configs in ConfigMaps and Secrets.                        |             |
| 🔥 Mount a Persistent Volume to store uploaded files or database data. |             |
| 🔥 Set up HPA to auto-scale based on load.                             |             |
| 🔥 Restrict namespace access via RBAC roles.                           |             |
| 🔥 Package your app as a Helm chart for reusability.                   |             |
| 🔥 Debug pod crashes using `kubectl logs` and `exec`.                  |             |

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **kubectl Core**:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs pod-name
kubectl exec -it pod-name -- bash
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
```

* **Minimal Deployment YAML**:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-container
          image: my-image:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

* **Service YAML**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer
```

* **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**:

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment my-app --cpu-percent=50 --min=2 --max=10
```

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendation

Once fluent with core Kubernetes:

* **ArgoCD** — GitOps-based Kubernetes deployments.
* **FluxCD** — Another GitOps engine.
* **Kustomize** — Declarative YAML customization.
* **Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd)** — Secure microservice networking.
* **KEDA** — Kubernetes Event-Driven Autoscaling.
* **Knative** — Serverless workloads on Kubernetes.

---

## 🎩 Pro Ops Tips

* Avoid running databases in Kubernetes unless necessary (stateful apps are hard to manage).
* Use Helm or Kustomize—stop duplicating YAML.
* Start with managed Kubernetes (EKS, AKS, GKE) before setting up bare-metal clusters.
* Always monitor your cluster (Prometheus + Grafana).
* Deploy with resource limits (`requests` and `limits`) to avoid noisy neighbors.

## ⚔️ Tactical Philosophy

**Kubernetes isn’t infrastructure—it’s application delivery at scale.**

Treat your manifests as code. Automate with GitOps. Secure aggressively. Observe relentlessly.
