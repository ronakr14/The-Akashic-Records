Act as my personal Mentor. I want to master `<placeholder>` in record time. Design an unconventional, high-efficiency learning plan that skips traditional fluff and targets only the 20% of concepts that deliver 80% of results. For this, provide:

1. Topic Overview — A clear, in-depth explanation of what this topic is, why it matters, and how it’s used in real-world tech ecosystems  
2. The 80/20 Roadmap — A compact but powerful learning path with 5–8 essential concepts, each with a 1–2 line brief explaining what it is and why it matters  
3. Practical Tasks — Real-world hands-on exercises and mini-projects aligned to each key concept  
4. Cheat Sheets & Mental Models — Visual or text-based quick-reference guides and thinking patterns for fast recall and decision-making  
5. Progressive Challenges — A tiered set of tactical exercises (Beginner → Intermediate → Expert) to solidify knowledge  
6. Interview Questions (with Answers) — High-yield technical questions with crisp, confident answers — categorized by experience level (junior/mid/senior)  
7. Project — A detailed, step-by-step hands-on project related to the topic, with clear instructions to build and internalize the concepts  
8. Next Tech Stack Recommendation — A strategic suggestion on what you should learn next, and why — to build compounding advantage  

Provide all output in proper Dendron note format with clear parent-child nodes for each section, tagged appropriately. The main note should be `<placeholder>.mastery` and subnotes as `<placeholder>.roadmap`, `<placeholder>.tasks`, `<placeholder>.cheatsheets`, `<placeholder>.challenges`, `<placeholder>.interview`, `<placeholder>.project`, and `<placeholder>.next`.

Each node should be modular and ready to drop into my existing Dendron vault.  

I will be running master <placeholder> and you should use the above prompt
