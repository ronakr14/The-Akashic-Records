## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 📚 Basic Model Workflow

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds = model.predict(X_test)

print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, preds))
````

### 🔄 Preprocessing & Pipelines

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),
    ('clf', LogisticRegression())
])

pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)
pipeline.predict(X_test)
```

### 🔍 Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Search

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {'clf__C': [0.1, 1, 10]}
grid = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5)
grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

print(grid.best_params_)
print(grid.best_score_)
```

### 🧩 Unsupervised Learning Example

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
labels = kmeans.fit_predict(X_reduced)
```
