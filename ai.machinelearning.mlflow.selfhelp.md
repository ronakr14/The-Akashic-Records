## 📌 Topic Overview

**MLflow** is the open-source Swiss Army knife for managing the entire ML lifecycle—from experimentation to reproducibility, deployment, and monitoring. It’s designed to bring **order to chaos** in data science projects by tracking experiments, packaging code, and deploying models consistently.

MLflow consists of four key components: **Tracking**, **Projects**, **Models**, and **Registry**, enabling data scientists and engineers to collaborate, reproduce, and productionize machine learning models with minimal friction.

> 🔍 Experiment tracking made easy  
> 📦 Package and reproduce ML code  
> 🚀 Deploy models anywhere  
> 🗂️ Centralized model registry

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

- ✅ Install and run MLflow Tracking server locally  
- ✅ Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts during model training  
- ✅ Query and compare past runs from the UI or API  
- ✅ Package an ML project with `MLproject` file and reproducible env  
- ✅ Save models with MLflow’s standardized format  
- ✅ Register, version, and stage models in the Model Registry  
- ✅ Deploy models with `mlflow models serve` and REST APIs  
- ✅ Enable auto-logging for popular ML libraries  
- ✅ Integrate MLflow tracking in custom training pipelines  
- ✅ Set up remote artifact storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS)

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔍 Basic Tracking Example

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

with mlflow.start_run():
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=3)
    clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
    preds = clf.predict(X_test)
    acc = accuracy_score(y_test, preds)

    mlflow.log_param("max_depth", 3)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", acc)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(clf, "model")
````

### 📦 MLproject File

```yaml
name: RandomForestProject
conda_env: conda.yaml
entry_points:
  main:
    parameters:
      max_depth: {type: int, default: 3}
    command: "python train.py --max_depth {max_depth}"
```

### 🏷️ Register and Transition Model

```python
client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()
model_uri = "runs:/<run_id>/model"
model_details = mlflow.register_model(model_uri, "RandomForestModel")

client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name="RandomForestModel",
    version=model_details.version,
    stage="Production"
)
```

### 🚀 Serve a Model Locally

```bash
mlflow models serve -m runs:/<run_id>/model -p 1234 --no-conda
```

### 🛠️ Enable Auto-Logging (e.g. scikit-learn)

```python
mlflow.sklearn.autolog()
```
