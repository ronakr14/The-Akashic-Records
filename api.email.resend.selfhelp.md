## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Focus Area                  | Why It Matters                                                   |
| ----- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Setup & API Key             | Core step: authenticate and start sending emails within minutes. |
| 2     | Sending Basics              | Learn transactional vs bulk sends via API/SDKs.                  |
| 3     | Templates & Personalization | Scale beyond plain text with branded, dynamic content.           |
| 4     | Deliverability & Domains    | Add verified domains, DKIM, SPF, and DMARC for inbox success.    |
| 5     | Event Tracking              | Capture opens, clicks, bounces, complaints via webhooks.         |

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **Send Email (JavaScript/TypeScript)**

  ```ts
  import { Resend } from 'resend';

  const resend = new Resend('API_KEY');

  await resend.emails.send({
    from: 'noreply@yourdomain.com',
    to: 'user@example.com',
    subject: 'Welcome!',
    html: '<p>Thanks for signing up 🚀</p>',
  });
  ```

* **Send Email (Python)**

  ```python
  from resend import Resend

  resend = Resend(api_key="API_KEY")

  resend.emails.send({
      "from": "noreply@yourdomain.com",
      "to": "user@example.com",
      "subject": "Welcome!",
      "html": "<p>Thanks for signing up 🚀</p>",
  })
  ```

* **Events Webhook Payload**

  ```json
  {
    "type": "email.delivered",
    "data": {
      "to": "user@example.com",
      "timestamp": "2025-09-22T10:00:00Z"

## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q1:** How is Resend different from SendGrid or SES?

  * Resend is API-first, modern DX (developer experience), simpler SDKs, no bloated dashboards, and strong TypeScript support. SES is cheap but complex; SendGrid is feature-rich but legacy-heavy.

* **Q2:** What are the key factors in email deliverability?

  * Verified domains, correct SPF/DKIM/DMARC, sending reputation, clean lists, and not spamming bulk recipients.

---

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **Postmark** → Focused on transactional reliability.
* **AWS SES** → Cheap at scale, but requires setup pain.
* **SendGrid** → More mature ecosystem, marketing + transactional.
* **Courier** → Multi-channel notifications (email, SMS, push).

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Always verify **SPF + DKIM** before production.
* Use **dedicated sending domain** (avoid using company’s root).
* Keep templates in Git for versioning.
* Start with **low volume warm-up** to build domain reputation.
* Leverage **webhooks** to power retries, analytics, and custom dashboards.

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

Email is still the **highest-leverage communication channel**. Resend isn’t just about firing off messages — it’s about treating email as part of your **product architecture**. Own your deliverability, automate feedback loops, and make every email a **scalable UX touchpoint**.
