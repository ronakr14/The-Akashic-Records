## 📌 Topic Overview

**Bash (Bourne Again SHell)** is the most widely used **command-line shell and scripting language** for Linux and Unix systems. It’s the glue of automation in DevOps, data engineering, and backend workflows.

Bash is **not just for running commands** — it's a full scripting language with variables, conditionals, loops, functions, error handling, and process control.

> In the automation universe, **Bash is your lightsaber** — lightweight, powerful, always at hand.

| Stage | Focus Area           | Why It Matters                                                    |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | Shell Basics         | Navigation, file ops, variables                                   |
| 2️⃣    | Conditionals & Loops | Building logic for repeatable automation                         |
| 3️⃣    | Functions & Scripts  | Modular, reusable shell scripts                                   |
| 4️⃣    | Input/Output         | Stdin/stdout/stderr, piping, redirection                          |
| 5️⃣    | Error Handling       | Exit codes, `trap`, `set -euo pipefail` for safe scripting        |
| 6️⃣    | CLI Flags            | Accepting `--args`, positional inputs with `getopts` or `argparse` |
| 7️⃣    | Crons & Background   | Scheduling & background execution                                 |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

- ✅ Create a script to automate file backups  
- ✅ Write a loop that monitors system resource usage  
- ✅ Build a script with flags: `--input`, `--output`, `--dry-run`  
- ✅ Add error handling + logging to all critical ops  
- ✅ Run a script in crontab every 15 minutes  
- ✅ Write one-liner commands for quick data processing

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### ▶️ Variables

```bash
name="Ronak"
echo "Hello, $name"
````

### ▶️ Conditionals

```bash
if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "Missing file"
fi
```

### ▶️ Loops

```bash
for f in *.txt; do
  echo "Found $f"
done
```

### ▶️ Functions

```bash
greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1"
}
greet "World"
```

### ▶️ Safe Bash Script Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
trap 'echo "Error on line $LINENO"' ERR
```

### ▶️ Accepting Arguments

```bash
while [[ "$#" -gt 0 ]]; do
  case $1 in
    --name) name="$2"; shift ;;
    --age) age="$2"; shift ;;
    *) echo "Unknown param $1"; exit 1 ;;
  esac
  shift
done
```

| 🥈 Intermediate | Create a backup script that compresses logs older than 7 days |
| 🥇 Advanced     | Build a CLI with flags: `--env`, `--path`, `--retries`        |
| 🏆 Expert       | Create a deploy pipeline using `bash`, `scp`, and `cron`      |

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **Ansible / Terraform** — Use Bash with infra automation
* **tmux / screen** — Persistent terminal sessions for long scripts
* **Python** — When Bash gets too ugly for string/data handling
* **yq / jq** — For parsing YAML/JSON in Bash pipelines
* **awk / sed / grep** — Data wrangling like a UNIX boss

## 🔍 Mental Model

> **“Think of Bash as glue for the command-line world.”** It’s fast, direct, and omnipresent. You don’t build an OS with it, but you **orchestrate, automate, and simplify** almost anything *around* the OS.

✅ Great for orchestration
✅ Amazing for automation
✅ Terrible for data structure logic — know when to hand over to Python
