## 📌 Topic Overview

**Apache Airflow** is a powerful platform to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows using Python. It’s the **de facto** tool in modern data engineering for orchestrating ETL jobs, model training, reporting pipelines, and any complex, time-sensitive task sequence.

Instead of manually running scripts or relying on brittle cron jobs, Airflow lets you define **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)**—reusable blueprints for automation. You get observability, retry policies, SLA tracking, parameterization, and modular pipelines with dynamic logic.

> 🚀 “Airflow isn’t just task scheduling. It’s a full-blown orchestration framework for the modern data stack.”

## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Concept                          | Why It Matters                                               |
|-------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | DAGs & Tasks                    | Core of Airflow. Define pipelines as Python functions         |
| 2️⃣    | Operators & Hooks               | Pre-built logic to interact with systems (Bash, SQL, S3, etc) |
| 3️⃣    | Scheduling & Intervals         | Define when and how often your DAGs run                       |
| 4️⃣    | Dependencies & Triggers        | Control the order and conditions for task execution           |
| 5️⃣    | Variables & Connections        | Parameterize DAGs and securely manage credentials             |
| 6️⃣    | XComs & Task Context           | Share data between tasks at runtime                           |
| 7️⃣    | Monitoring & Logging           | Track task status, retry, alert on failures                   |
| 8️⃣    | Backfilling & Catchup          | Handle historical reprocessing with control                   |
| 9️⃣    | Plugins & Custom Operators     | Extend Airflow's functionality for your use case              |
| 🔟    | Docker & Kubernetes Deployment  | Run Airflow reliably in containers or cloud-native setups     |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

- ✅ Create your first DAG with 3 tasks: extract → transform → load  
- ✅ Use `PythonOperator`, `BashOperator`, and `DummyOperator`  
- ✅ Setup Postgres or SQLite as Airflow backend  
- ✅ Schedule a DAG to run every hour using cron syntax  
- ✅ Use `Variable.get()` to read secrets or configs  
- ✅ Trigger a DAG manually via CLI or UI  
- ✅ Build retry and timeout logic into a flaky task  
- ✅ Use `EmailOperator` for failure notifications  
- ✅ Log task outputs for debugging  
- ✅ Deploy Airflow using Docker Compose or Helm chart

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 📄 Minimal DAG Template

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def hello():
    print("Hello, Airflow!")

with DAG("my_dag", start_date=datetime(2024,1,1), schedule_interval="@daily", catchup=False) as dag:
    task = PythonOperator(task_id="say_hello", python_callable=hello)
````

### 🧪 XComs Example

```python
def push_data(**context):
    context['ti'].xcom_push(key='msg', value='hello')

def pull_data(**context):
    msg = context['ti'].xcom_pull(task_ids='push_data', key='msg')
    print(msg)
```

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🥉 Beginner     | Create a DAG with Bash and Python operators                              |
| 🥈 Intermediate | Use S3Hook to move files from local to S3                                |
| 🥇 Advanced     | Build a data pipeline with branching logic and failure retries           |
| 🏆 Expert       | Deploy Airflow in Kubernetes with autoscaling and dynamic DAG generation |

## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** What are the core components of Airflow's architecture?
* **Q:** How does Airflow differ from cron or traditional schedulers?
* **Q:** What’s the difference between task dependencies and trigger rules?
* **Q:** How do you share data between tasks?
* **Q:** How do you scale Airflow for hundreds of DAGs?

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **Great Expectations** — Add data validation checkpoints into DAGs
* **dbt Cloud / CLI** — Trigger dbt jobs as part of transformation
* **Docker + Docker Compose** — Local, containerized orchestration
* **Kubernetes (Helm + Astronomer)** — Production-grade orchestration
* **Prefect** — Modern alternative to Airflow with better local dev support
* **Dagster** — Typed, declarative pipelines with strong DAG semantics

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Avoid writing dynamic DAGs inside a loop—generate tasks with `TaskGroup`
* Store configs/secrets using Airflow Variables and Connections—not in code
* Use `catchup=False` if your DAG doesn't need backfilling
* Use `@task` decorator in Airflow 2.x to simplify DAG code (TaskFlow API)
* Keep DAG files lightweight—move heavy logic to external modules

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

> "Airflow isn’t just a scheduler. It's the nervous system of your data ecosystem."

🧠 Think DAG-first: every task has dependencies
🚥 Fail fast: retries + alerting saves hours
🔌 Build reusable operators/hooks—don’t hardcode logic
📦 Version control your DAGs
🧪 Test locally with `airflow test` before deployment
