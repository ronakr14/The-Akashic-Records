## 📌 Topic Overview

**ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** is a data integration pattern where:

* **Extract** raw data from source systems (databases, APIs, files).
* **Load** raw or lightly processed data directly into a **data lake or data warehouse** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).
* **Transform** data *in place* inside the target system, using its built-in compute power and SQL capabilities.

**Why ELT?**

* Exploits scalable cloud warehouses with MPP (Massively Parallel Processing).
* Faster ingestion — no bottleneck from complex transformations before load.
* Enables reprocessing and evolving transformations on-demand.
* Simplifies pipeline design and reduces orchestration overhead.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔹 Snowflake Bulk Load (COPY command)

```sql
COPY INTO my_table
FROM @my_stage/file.csv
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"');
```

### 🔹 Incremental Load Pattern (SQL)

```sql
WITH latest_data AS (
  SELECT * FROM raw_table WHERE updated_at > (SELECT MAX(updated_at) FROM target_table)
)
INSERT INTO target_table
SELECT * FROM latest_data;
```

### 🔹 dbt Model Example (transform.sql)

```sql
WITH cleaned AS (
  SELECT
    id,
    LOWER(email) AS email,
    created_at::date AS signup_date
  FROM {{ ref('raw_users') }}
  WHERE email IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT * FROM cleaned;
```

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Keep raw data immutable in staging—never overwrite to maintain audit trail.
* Push complex transformations down to the warehouse where scalability is king.
* Use dbt for modular, version-controlled transformations and testing.
* Automate incremental loads using CDC or watermark columns to save cost.
* Monitor query cost and optimize clustering/partitioning to control spend.
* Track data lineage tightly to debug issues and satisfy auditors.

## ⚔️ Tactical Philosophy

> ELT lets you harness the cloud warehouse’s massive compute, ditch brittle pre-load transformations, and iterate fast on your data models.

Build pipelines that are:

* Resilient and repeatable
* Modular and testable
* Cost-conscious and performant
* Transparent and well-documented
