## 📌 Topic Overview

**Selenium** is the gold standard for **automated browser testing**. It’s a suite of tools for automating web browsers through scripts, mimicking real user interactions like clicks, inputs, scrolling, and validation.

> TL;DR: Selenium lets you drpive a browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) as if a real user is sitting there — but without the coffee breaks.

Selenium supports multiple languages (Python, Java, C#, JS), works across platforms, and integrates with modern test frameworks (like PyTest, JUnit, TestNG), CI/CD systems, and reporting tools.

## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Concept                  | Why It Matters                                                      |
|-------|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | Selenium WebDriver       | The core engine that controls browsers                              |
| 2️⃣    | Locators & Selectors     | Identify elements via XPath, CSS, ID, etc.                          |
| 3️⃣    | Actions & Assertions     | Mimic user interactions and verify expected results                 |
| 4️⃣    | Waits & Synchronization | Handle page loads, AJAX, and dynamic elements                       |
| 5️⃣    | Page Object Model (POM) | Scalable, reusable test architecture                                |
| 6️⃣    | Screenshots & Logs       | Capture evidence of test execution                                 |
| 7️⃣    | Parallel Execution       | Run tests faster with threading/grid                                |
| 8️⃣    | Headless Testing         | Run tests without UI in CI/CD pipelines                             |
| 9️⃣    | CI/CD Integration        | Automate test runs with Jenkins/GitHub Actions                      |

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### ▶️ Basic Script (Python)

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com")

title = driver.title
print("Page Title:", title)

search_box = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "q")
search_box.send_keys("Selenium testing")
search_box.submit()

driver.quit()
````

---

### ▶️ Explicit Wait

```python
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)
element = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "result")))
```

---

### ▶️ Headless Mode

```python
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

options = Options()
options.add_argument("--headless")
driver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
```

| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🥉 Beginner     | Automate login + logout to a demo site                           |
| 🥈 Intermediate | Implement full Page Object Model for an e-commerce workflow      |
| 🥇 Advanced     | Run tests in parallel using PyTest xdist or Selenium Grid        |
| 🏆 Expert       | Integrate Selenium with Jenkins + Allure Report + Slack notifier |

## 🔍 Mental Model

> “Think of Selenium like a robotic user — it opens your browser, clicks buttons, types text, reads responses, and tells you if something breaks.”

* ✅ WebDriver = the robot’s brain
* ✅ Locators = the robot’s eyes
* ✅ Actions = the robot’s hands
* ✅ Waits = the robot’s patience
* ✅ POM = the robot’s memory system
