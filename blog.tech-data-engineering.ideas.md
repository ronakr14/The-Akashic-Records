The Hidden Cost of Using Too Many Tools in Your Data Stack

What you’d write:

Hook: “Every startup today has a zoo of tools — Airbyte, dbt, Snowflake, Looker, and 7 more. But is it sustainable?”

Core topics:

Tool sprawl → higher costs, higher failure points, more training overhead.

Vendor lock-in.

Engineering fatigue (context switching).

Strategies to simplify: fewer tools, modular stack, open-source-first.

Could include real-world horror stories: e.g., migrating 10 connectors, maintaining 50 DAGs, burning $$$ on SaaS fees.

Impact potential:

💥 Big hit on LinkedIn — resonates with managers, architects, and even finance folks.

🚨 Contrarian + conversation starter (“we don’t need 12 tools to do ETL”).

🌍 Timely — everyone’s talking about cost-cutting in data infra.

Downside:

Less technical depth, more opinion piece.

Might trigger defensive comments (“But dbt is worth every penny!”) — which can actually increase engagement.
