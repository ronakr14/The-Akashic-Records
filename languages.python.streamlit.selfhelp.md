## 📌 Topic Overview

**Streamlit** is a fast-growing open-source Python framework designed to build **data apps and interactive dashboards** with minimal effort. Forget HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—just write Python scripts, and Streamlit turns them into beautiful web apps instantly.

> Think of Streamlit as the **Pythonic “press-button-to-web” magic wand** for data scientists and engineers.

It’s perfect for rapid prototyping, sharing ML demos, data visualization, and even internal tools.

## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Concept                    | Why It Matters                                                |
|-------|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | Streamlit Basics           | Create and run your first app with `streamlit run`            |
| 2️⃣    | Widgets & User Input       | Capture user input with sliders, buttons, text inputs         |
| 3️⃣    | Layout & Containers        | Organize app UI with columns, tabs, expanders                 |
| 4️⃣    | Data Display               | Show tables, charts (Matplotlib, Altair, Plotly), markdown    |
| 5️⃣    | State Management           | Manage interaction state with `st.session_state`              |
| 6️⃣    | Media & Files              | Upload/download files, display images and audio               |
| 7️⃣    | Deployment                | Deploy on Streamlit Cloud, Docker, or cloud platforms          |
| 8️⃣    | Performance Optimization  | Cache heavy computations with `@st.cache_data` and `@st.cache_resource` |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

- ✅ Install Streamlit: `pip install streamlit`  
- ✅ Build a simple app displaying a title and data table  
- ✅ Add widgets like sliders, select boxes, and buttons  
- ✅ Use charts from `st.line_chart()`, `st.bar_chart()`, or integrate Plotly/Altair  
- ✅ Manage input-driven app state with `st.session_state`  
- ✅ Enable file upload and download functionality  
- ✅ Deploy an app on Streamlit Cloud or Heroku  
- ✅ Cache expensive function results to speed up app

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### ▶️ Basic App

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

st.title("My First Streamlit App")

data = pd.DataFrame({
    "Numbers": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "Squares": [1, 4, 9, 16]
})

st.write(data)
````

Run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

### ▶️ User Input Widgets

```python
age = st.slider("Select your age", 0, 100, 25)
color = st.selectbox("Pick a color", ["Red", "Green", "Blue"])
if st.button("Submit"):
    st.write(f"You chose {age} years old and color {color}")
```

---

### ▶️ Layout Example

```python
col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
with col1:
    st.header("Left Column")
    st.write("Some content")
with col2:
    st.header("Right Column")
    st.write("Other content")
```

---

### ▶️ Caching Functions

```python
@st.cache_data
def expensive_computation(x):
    # simulate expensive operation
    import time
    time.sleep(5)
    return x * x

result = expensive_computation(10)
st.write(result)
```
