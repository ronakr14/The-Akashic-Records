## 📌 Topic Overview

**Oracle Database** (Oracle DB) is a multi-model, enterprise-grade **relational database system** built by Oracle Corporation. It’s known for:

* **PL/SQL**: Its own procedural extension to SQL.
* **ACID compliance** and **multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)**.
* Built-in **replication, partitioning, sharding**, and **data compression**.
* High-performance features like **Oracle RAC (Real Application Clusters)**, **Data Guard**, and **Exadata**.
* Integration with **Java, XML, JSON, Spatial**, and more.

Used in **banking, insurance, telecom, ERP, and massive legacy systems**, it's the beating heart of many Fortune 500 backends.

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

* ✅ Install Oracle 19c XE or set up a cloud-based Oracle instance
* ✅ Use SQL\*Plus or SQL Developer to connect and run queries
* ✅ Create a schema, table, and add constraints
* ✅ Write a PL/SQL block that loops over a cursor and performs conditional updates
* ✅ Configure tablespaces and assign them to users
* ✅ Use `EXPLAIN PLAN` and `AUTOTRACE` to optimize queries
* ✅ Load CSV data using `SQL*Loader`
* ✅ Schedule a job using **DBMS\_SCHEDULER**
* ✅ Perform a hot backup using **RMAN**
* ✅ Set up Data Pump export/import for cross-system migration

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔹 Basic SQL + PL/SQL

```sql
BEGIN
  FOR rec IN (SELECT * FROM employees) LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(rec.name);
  END LOOP;
END;
```

### 🔹 Stored Procedure

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_salary(p_id IN NUMBER, p_amt IN NUMBER) AS
BEGIN
  UPDATE employees SET salary = salary + p_amt WHERE id = p_id;
  COMMIT;
END;
```

### 🔹 Tablespace Creation

```sql
CREATE TABLESPACE sales_data
DATAFILE '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/SALES01.DBF' SIZE 100M;
```

### 🔹 Partitioning

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id NUMBER,
  order_date DATE
)
PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date) (
  PARTITION q1 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('2024-04-01','YYYY-MM-DD')),
  PARTITION q2 VALUES LESS THAN (TO_DATE('2024-07-01','YYYY-MM-DD'))
);
```

## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q:** What is the difference between `IN`, `OUT`, and `IN OUT` in PL/SQL?
* **Q:** How does Oracle handle MVCC?
* **Q:** What are latches vs locks in Oracle?
* **Q:** When do you use packages instead of procedures?
* **Q:** What’s the use of `DBMS_STATS`?
* **Q:** How do you tune high-CPU queries in Oracle?

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **Oracle APEX** — Build web apps directly on Oracle DB
* **Oracle GoldenGate** — Real-time replication and CDC
* **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)** — DBaaS deployments
* **Flyway or Liquibase** — Oracle-compatible schema migration
* **Python + cx\_Oracle or SQLAlchemy** — Oracle in data workflows

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE` to debug PL/SQL blocks
* Avoid implicit cursors—use **explicit** ones for control
* Regularly gather stats with `DBMS_STATS` for optimizer efficiency
* Leverage **bulk collect** and **forall** for high-volume operations
* Use `AUTOTRACE` to compare logical vs physical reads during query tuning
* Monitor sessions with `V$SESSION`, locks with `V$LOCK`

---

## 💣 Oracle Gotchas

* **Autocommit in SQL Developer** can be dangerous in transactions
* Oracle’s **case sensitivity** applies to identifiers only when quoted
* **Data types** like `NUMBER`, `VARCHAR2`, `CLOB`, and `BLOB` have quirks—know them
* **Rollback segments** can trip up long-running transactions

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

> Oracle DB is **not** just a data store. It’s a programmable runtime, scheduler, transaction manager, and parallel compute engine **masquerading as a database**.

🧪 Treat PL/SQL like a first-class language
🛠 Design with performance, not just data modeling
🧠 Understand architecture to survive production fire drills
📉 Profile your slowest queries weekly—proactively, not reactively
