## 📌 Topic Overview

**Perplexity** is a **core metric used to evaluate language models**, particularly autoregressive models like GPT, by measuring how “surprised” a model is by a sequence of words. In simpler terms, it tells you **how well a model can predict the next word** in a sentence.

> Think of it like golf: **lower perplexity = better prediction = better language model.**

### Formula:
For a given sentence with tokens \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \):
```

Perplexity = exp(-1/N \* Σ log(P(x\_i)))

````
Where:
- \( P(x_i) \) = probability assigned by the model to token \( x_i \)
- N = number of tokens

| Stage | Concept                | Why It Matters                                               |
|-------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1️⃣    | What perplexity measures | Fluency & predictive confidence of the LLM                   |
| 2️⃣    | How it’s calculated     | Understand the log-likelihood math behind it                 |
| 3️⃣    | Tokenization impact     | Perplexity is token-based, not character- or word-based      |
| 4️⃣    | Use cases in evaluation | Benchmarking LLMs on new datasets or prompt styles           |
| 5️⃣    | Language model tuning   | Optimize training loss = lower perplexity                    |
| 6️⃣    | Comparing models        | Lower perplexity = better generalization (not always!)       |
| 7️⃣    | Caveats                 | High perplexity ≠ always bad (e.g., creative or rare text)   |

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### ▶️ Perplexity in HuggingFace Transformers

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch
import math

model_name = "gpt2"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
model.eval()

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs, labels=inputs["input_ids"])
    loss = outputs.loss
    perplexity = math.exp(loss.item())

print(f"Perplexity: {perplexity}")
````

### 🧠 Rule of Thumb

| Perplexity Range | Interpretation                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| \~10–50          | Good model for general text         |
| >100             | Model is unsure, under-trained      |
| <10              | Very confident model or overfitting |

## 🔍 Mental Model

> “Perplexity is the model asking: *how many choices did I think were likely?* — The lower, the better I understood your language.”

* ✅ Useful for comparing models of same architecture
* ❌ Not a standalone metric for production model quality
* ✅ Best combined with BLEU, ROUGE, accuracy, or human eval
