# 🌍 Algorithms → Real-World Case Studies

---

## 📈 **Regression Algorithms (predicting continuous values)**

* **Linear Regression** →

  * Predicting **house prices** from features (sqft, location, bedrooms).
  * Forecasting **sales revenue** given marketing spend.
* **Polynomial Regression** →

  * Predicting **demand curves** in economics.
* **Ridge/Lasso Regression** →

  * Lasso: **feature selection** in genomics (which genes matter).
  * Ridge: **predicting stock prices** with tons of noisy variables.

---

## 📨 **Classification Algorithms (predicting categories)**

* **Logistic Regression** →

  * Credit scoring: approve/reject **loan applications**.
  * Healthcare: predict **disease diagnosis** (e.g., diabetes: yes/no).

* **kNN** →

  * **Recommendation for small datasets** (e.g., “customers similar to you bought X”).
  * Image recognition in early systems.

* **Naive Bayes** →

  * **Spam detection** in email.
  * Text classification → sentiment analysis (“positive” vs. “negative” reviews).

* **SVM** →

  * **Bioinformatics**: classify cancerous vs. non-cancerous cells.
  * Text categorization for small-to-medium datasets.

---

## 🌳 **Decision Trees**

* Retail → **customer churn prediction**.
* Finance → **risk assessment** (loan repayment probability).
* Healthcare → decision support (“If age > 50 & smoker → higher risk category”).

---

## 🌲 **Ensemble Methods (the real MVPs)**

* **Random Forest** →

  * Predict **employee attrition** (HR analytics).
  * Detect **faults in manufacturing**.

* **Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)** →

  * **Fraud detection** in banking → catches subtle patterns.
  * **Credit risk modeling** → widely used by fintechs.
  * **Customer churn** prediction → telecom, SaaS.
  * **Click-through rate (CTR) prediction** in advertising.
  * **Competition-winning models** on Kaggle.

* **Stacking** →

  * E-commerce → blend multiple models to improve **personalized recommendations**.
  * Insurance → predict **claim amounts** more accurately.

---

## 🔍 **Clustering (unsupervised)**

* **k-Means** →

  * Customer segmentation → marketing (group users by purchasing behavior).
  * Market basket analysis → retailers (grouping products often bought together).

* **Hierarchical Clustering** →

  * **Gene expression analysis** in biology.
  * Document clustering (grouping similar articles).

* **DBSCAN** →

  * **Outlier detection** in network security (intrusion detection).
  * Detecting abnormal patterns in IoT sensor data.

---

## ✂️ **Dimensionality Reduction**

* **PCA** →

  * **Face recognition** (Eigenfaces).
  * Reduce features in high-dimensional datasets (like genomics).

* **t-SNE/UMAP** →

  * Visualizing high-dimensional customer segments.
  * Visualizing embeddings in NLP.

---

## 🎬 **Recommendation Systems**

* **Collaborative Filtering** →

  * Netflix: “Users who liked this movie also liked X.”
  * Amazon: “People who bought this also bought Y.”

* **Content-Based Filtering** →

  * Spotify: recommends music with similar audio features.
  * News websites: articles similar to what you read.

* **Hybrid Systems** →

  * YouTube, TikTok: combine collaborative + content features + deep learning embeddings.

---

## 🚗 **Reinforcement Learning**

(Not the main focus yet, but real-world highlights)

* **Self-driving cars** → learning driving policies.
* **Robotics** → grasping and manipulation.
* **Game AI** → AlphaGo, OpenAI Five (Dota 2).
* **Recommender systems optimization** → dynamically adjusting feeds (TikTok, Instagram).

---

# 🏆 TL;DR (Algorithm → Use Case Cheat Sheet)

* **Linear/Logistic Regression** → Baseline models, finance, healthcare.
* **Naive Bayes** → Spam detection, text classification.
* **Decision Trees** → Risk analysis, churn prediction.
* **Random Forest** → Manufacturing, HR attrition.
* **Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)** → Fraud detection, credit scoring, CTR prediction.
* **Clustering (k-Means/DBSCAN)** → Customer segmentation, anomaly detection.
* **PCA/UMAP** → Feature reduction, visualization.
* **Recommenders** → Netflix, Spotify, Amazon.
