## 📌 Topic Overview

**Amazon Web Services (AWS)** is:

* The world’s largest **cloud computing platform**.
* Enables:

  * On-demand servers (EC2, Lambda)
  * Scalable storage (S3, EBS)
  * Databases (RDS, DynamoDB)
  * Networking (VPC)
  * Security (IAM)
  * Serverless apps (API Gateway, Lambda)
  * Data pipelines, ML services, DevOps tools

**Why Master AWS?**

* Automate infrastructure.
* Build globally available applications.
* Scale from zero to millions of users.
* Avoid vendor lock-in with modular services.
* Power AI/ML pipelines, analytics workloads, and SaaS products.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **S3 Upload (AWS CLI)**:

```bash
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://mybucket/file.txt
```

* **EC2 Launch (CLI)**:

```bash
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-xyz --instance-type t2.micro
```

* **Lambda Sample Function (Python)**:

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {"statusCode": 200, "body": "Hello from Lambda!"}
```

* **IAM Policy Snippet (S3 Full Access)**:

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

* **Deploy CloudFormation Stack**:

```bash
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file infra.yaml --stack-name my-stack
```

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendation

* **AWS CDK** — Code-first infrastructure provisioning.
* **Terraform** — Multi-cloud IaC tool.
* **ECS / EKS** — Docker and Kubernetes orchestration on AWS.
* **Step Functions** — Build distributed workflows.
* **AWS Athena + Glue** — Serverless analytics pipelines.

---

## 🎩 Pro Ops Tips

* Apply **least privilege** policies—never use admin-wide permissions.
* Leverage **S3 versioning and lifecycle policies** for backup & cost control.
* Automate EC2 provisioning via **Auto Scaling Groups** and Load Balancers.
* Prefer **serverless** where possible for scalability and cost savings.
* Encrypt everything: data at rest (KMS), data in transit (TLS).

## ⚔️ Tactical Philosophy

**AWS isn’t just infrastructure—it’s your software supply chain.**

Build systems that are:

* Modular
* Secure
* Automated
* Scalable

Think cloud-native from day one.
