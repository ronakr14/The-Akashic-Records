## üìå Topic Overview

**LangGraph** is:

* A framework for building **graph-based LLM applications**.
* A **state machine orchestration layer** built on LangChain.
* Allows cycles, conditionals, memory, and dynamic routing within your chains.

Why it matters:

* Linear chains hit limits fast (e.g. no loops, no conditional steps).
* LangGraph lets you build:

  * Multi-turn agents with proper state.
  * Conditional LLM workflows.
  * Error-handling and fallback paths.
  * Complex decision trees powered by LLM reasoning.

In short: **LangGraph = Logic + LLMs + Control Flow**.

## üöÄ Practical Tasks

| Task                                                                                           | Description |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| üî• Build a graph with 3 nodes: input, processing, output.                                      |             |
| üî• Implement a loop where the LLM refines its answer until confidence threshold met.           |             |
| üî• Build conditional routing: if LLM detects "math problem", route to calculator tool.         |             |
| üî• Create a multi-agent system using specialized subgraphs (research agent, summarizer agent). |             |
| üî• Serialize a running graph state and resume later.                                           |             |
| üî• Wrap graph as a FastAPI service for production deployment.                                  |             |

## üßæ Cheat Sheets

* **Basic Graph Node**:

```python
import langgraph

def node_logic(state):
    # Your LLM chain or custom logic
    return {"response": "Processed: " + state["input"]}

graph = langgraph.Graph()
graph.add_node("processor", node_logic)
graph.add_edge("start", "processor")
graph.add_edge("processor", "end")
```

* **Conditional Edge**:

```python
def branching_logic(state):
    if "math" in state["input"]:
        return "calculator_node"
    return "general_llm_node"

graph.add_conditional_edges("router_node", branching_logic)
```

* **Cycles / Loops Example**:

```python
# From 'review' node, return to 'refiner' node until condition met
graph.add_edge("review", "refiner")
```

* **Run Graph**:

```python
result = graph.run({"input": "Hello, world!"})
```

## üõ£Ô∏è Next Tech Stack Recommendation

Once LangGraph mastery is unlocked:

* **LangChain Agents** ‚Äî Pair with graph control for complex reasoning.
* **AsyncLangGraph** ‚Äî Concurrent graph execution.
* **Ollama / Local LLaMA** ‚Äî Power your LangGraph with local models.
* **FastAPI + Redis** ‚Äî Serve and persist graph sessions at scale.
* **Kubernetes / Docker Swarm** ‚Äî Deploy multi-agent architectures at enterprise scale.

## üé© Pro Ops Tips

* Use **state dicts** as your data carrier between nodes.
* Nodes can be entire LLM chains, not just single steps.
* Log transitions to visualize execution flow (use graphviz).
* Avoid single mega-graphs. Build **modular subgraphs** and compose.
* Handle exceptions inside nodes; define fallback edges where needed.

---

## ‚öîÔ∏è Tactical Philosophy

**LangGraph transforms your LLM workflows from ‚Äúprompt pipelines‚Äù to engineered, state-aware systems.**

Architect workflows like backend APIs. Think state machines. Think graphs. Design for failure.
