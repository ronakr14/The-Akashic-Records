## 📌 Topic Overview

**Databricks** is a unified **data analytics and AI platform** built on top of Apache Spark. It pioneers the **Lakehouse Architecture**, combining the flexibility of data lakes with the reliability and performance of data warehouses.

Databricks provides a **collaborative notebook interface**, supports **batch, streaming, and ML workloads**, and is deeply integrated with major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP). It offers managed Spark clusters, **Delta Lake**, MLFlow, and a serverless experience for data engineers, analysts, and scientists.

**Core Pillars:**
- **Lakehouse Architecture** (Delta Lake)
- Apache Spark at its core (ETL, Streaming, ML)
- Unified workspace for **Data + AI**
- Serverless & Auto-scaling clusters
- Native support for **Python, SQL, Scala, R**
- Tight integration with **MLflow**, **Unity Catalog**, and BI tools

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔥 Delta Lake

```python
# Save data as Delta table
df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/mnt/delta/sales")

# Read Delta
df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/delta/sales")

# Time Travel
df = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 3).load("/mnt/delta/sales")

# Optimize
OPTIMIZE sales ZORDER BY (country, date);
````

### 🧠 MLflow Tracking

```python
import mlflow

with mlflow.start_run():
    mlflow.log_param("alpha", 0.05)
    mlflow.log_metric("rmse", 0.91)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

### ⏱ Structured Streaming

```python
query = df.writeStream \
    .format("delta") \
    .outputMode("append") \
    .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/checkpoints/stream") \
    .start("/mnt/delta/stream_data")
```

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

> **Databricks is not just a Spark wrapper — it's a full-stack data platform for unified analytics, engineering, and AI.**

⚡ Treat Delta like a database, not just a file format
🔍 Use Lakehouse features to bridge analytics and science
🔐 Think about **governance, lineage, reproducibility** from day one
🏗 Build modular code: notebooks, jobs, and repos should act like services
💡 Make MLflow your experiment GPS — don’t ship untracked models
