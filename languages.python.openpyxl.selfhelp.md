## üßæ Cheat Sheets

* **Create Workbook and Save**:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.active
ws.title = "Report"
wb.save("report.xlsx")
```

* **Write Data to Cells**:

```python
ws['A1'] = "Name"
ws.append(["Ronak", 42, "Data Engineer"])
```

* **Read Cell Value**:

```python
value = ws['A1'].value
```

* **Style Cells**:

```python
from openpyxl.styles import Font, PatternFill

ws['A1'].font = Font(bold=True, color="FF0000")
ws['A1'].fill = PatternFill(start_color="FFFF00", fill_type="solid")
```

* **Add Formula**:

```python
ws['C1'] = "=SUM(B1:B10)"
```

* **Merge Cells**:

```python
ws.merge_cells('A1:C1')
```

* **Add Chart**:

```python
from openpyxl.chart import BarChart, Reference

chart = BarChart()
data = Reference(ws, min_col=2, min_row=1, max_col=2, max_row=10)
chart.add_data(data, titles_from_data=True)
ws.add_chart(chart, "E5")
```

## üé© Pro Ops Tips

* Avoid modifying very large Excel files cell-by-cell; batch operations or `pandas` may be faster.
* Use styles sparingly‚Äîexcessive styling slows down writes.
* Always close/save workbooks explicitly to avoid corruption.
* Test Excel output on real Excel clients (Office, LibreOffice) for compatibility.
* Leverage formulas to offload calculations to Excel‚Äôs engine instead of Python.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Tactical Philosophy

**OpenPyXL makes Excel automation accessible, but mastery means blending Pythonic data handling with spreadsheet savvy.**

Think beyond static Excel ‚Äî think dynamic, reusable, and integrated data workflows.
