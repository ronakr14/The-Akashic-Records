## 📌 Topic Overview

> Think of **Mermaid** as *Markdown’s best friend for diagrams — a text-based way to create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, and more, all without opening Figma or Visio*.

## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Focus Area         | Why It Matters                                                            |
| ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Setup & Basics     | You can generate diagrams with plain text, no design tools needed.        |
| 2     | Core Diagram Types | Flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams — 80% of use cases.         |
| 3     | Embedding in Docs  | Works inside Markdown (MkDocs, GitHub, Obsidian, Notion, etc.).           |
| 4     | Styling & Themes   | Make diagrams readable and branded (dark/light, custom colors).           |
| 5     | Advanced Diagrams  | Gantt charts, state diagrams, ERD — for complex workflows.                |
| 6     | Automation         | Generate diagrams dynamically in CI/CD, dashboards, or knowledge systems. |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

* ✅ Install Mermaid via npm (`npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli`).
* ✅ Create your first flowchart in Markdown.
* ✅ Render sequence diagram for API calls.
* ✅ Embed Mermaid in MkDocs Material (`pymdownx.superfences`).
* ✅ Try custom themes (dark/light).
* ✅ Export diagrams as SVG/PNG via CLI.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **Flowchart**

  ```mermaid
  graph TD
    A[User] --> B[Login]
    B -->|Success| C[Dashboard]
    B -->|Failure| D[Error Page]
  ```

* **Sequence Diagram**

  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant S as Server
    U->>S: Request Data
    S-->>U: Response
  ```

* **Gantt Chart**

  ```mermaid
  gantt
    dateFormat  YYYY-MM-DD
    title Project Roadmap
    section Planning
      Spec writing :a1, 2025-09-01, 5d
    section Dev
      Coding :a2, after a1, 10d
      Testing :a3, after a2, 5d
  ```

* **Class Diagram**

  ```mermaid
  classDiagram
    class Animal {
      +String name
      +eat()
    }
    class Dog {
      +bark()
    }
    Animal <|-- Dog
  ```

* **State Diagram**

  ```mermaid
  stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle
    Idle --> Running
    Running --> Idle
    Running --> Error
  ```

| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🥉 Beginner     | Draw a flowchart for a simple login process.                  |
| 🥈 Intermediate | Build a sequence diagram for a client-server API call.        |
| 🥇 Advanced     | Create a Gantt chart for a sprint timeline with dependencies. |
| 🏆 Expert       | Automate Mermaid diagram generation from JSON/YAML in CI/CD.  |

## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q1:** Why use Mermaid instead of drawing diagrams manually?

  * Mermaid makes diagrams **versionable, reproducible, and automatable**. No dragging boxes around — your diagram lives as code.

* **Q2:** How does Mermaid integrate with MkDocs or GitHub?

  * With MkDocs Material, use `pymdownx.superfences` to render Mermaid directly. GitHub also supports Mermaid natively in Markdown files.

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **PlantUML** → More advanced UML diagrams, heavier setup.
* **Graphviz** → Powerful graph visualization with DOT language.
* **D2 (Declarative Diagramming)** → New competitor, faster rendering.
* **Obsidian + Mermaid** → For personal knowledge management.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Keep diagrams **small and modular** — don’t cram an entire system into one graph.
* Use **subgraphs** in flowcharts for clarity.
* Theme diagrams with **CSS overrides** for branding.
* Export diagrams in **SVG** for embedding in docs or slides.
* For **dynamic diagrams**, generate `.mmd` files from code/data.

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

Diagrams should be **living architecture**, not dead PNGs buried in Confluence. Mermaid brings diagrams into the same lifecycle as code: version control, CI/CD, reviewable, and always up to date. A system diagram in Markdown is just as powerful as the SQL schema it represents.
