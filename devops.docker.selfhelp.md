## 📌 Topic Overview

**Docker** is a containerization platform that lets you package applications (code, dependencies, configs) into isolated units called **containers**. Unlike virtual machines, containers are lightweight, fast, and designed for microservice architectures and CI/CD pipelines.

Why Docker matters:

* Eliminate environment drift
* CI/CD pipelines rely on container builds
* Fundamental for Kubernetes, serverless, and edge computing

In short: **If your app isn’t containerized, your deployment strategy is prehistoric.**

## ⚡ 80/20 Roadmap

Focus on **core commands + real-world workflows**.

| Stage  | Focus Area                                           | Why?                                                       |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | Dockerfile basics (FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD, ENTRYPOINT) | Core skill: Build images cleanly.                          |
| **2**  | docker build / docker run / docker exec / docker ps  | CLI fluency—no GUI shortcuts.                              |
| **3**  | docker-compose.yml                                   | Multi-container orchestration without Kubernetes overhead. |
| **4**  | Docker volumes, bind mounts                          | Handle persistent storage (databases, configs).            |
| **5**  | Multi-stage builds                                   | Production-grade images without unnecessary bloat.         |
| **6**  | Networking (bridge, host, overlay)                   | Real microservice networking.                              |
| **7**  | Image optimization & caching                         | Faster builds, smaller deploys.                            |
| **8**  | Docker registry (Docker Hub, private registries)     | Push/pull images like code artifacts.                      |
| **9**  | Container security (non-root user, secrets)          | Harden containers for production.                          |
| **10** | Integration with CI/CD                               | Use Docker inside GitHub Actions, Jenkins pipelines.       |

## 🚀 Practical Tasks

| Task                                                                           | Description |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| 🔥 Containerize a Python/Node.js API using a custom Dockerfile.                |             |
| 🔥 Use `docker-compose` to spin up app + Postgres + Redis services locally.    |             |
| 🔥 Build a **multi-stage Dockerfile** for minimal production images.           |             |
| 🔥 Set up bind mounts to auto-reload source code inside a running container.   |             |
| 🔥 Push your custom image to Docker Hub (or private registry).                 |             |
| 🔥 Simulate a microservice network using Docker bridge networks.               |             |
| 🔥 Use Docker inside a GitHub Actions pipeline for automated testing & builds. |             |

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **Dockerfile Example**:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

* **CLI Core Commands**:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 8080:80 my-app
docker exec -it container_id /bin/bash
docker ps
docker stop container_id
docker images
docker rmi image_id
```

* **docker-compose.yml**:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: secret
```

* **Volume Mounting**:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd):/app my-app
```

* **Multi-Stage Build Snippet**:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install && npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
```

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendation

After Docker, step into:

* **Kubernetes** — Orchestrate containers at scale.
* **Helm** — Package management for Kubernetes.
* **BuildKit** — Modern, faster Docker builds.
* **Podman** — Docker alternative, daemonless.
* **AWS ECS / EKS** — Production container hosting.
* **Tilt / Skaffold** — Local Kubernetes dev pipelines.

## 🎩 Pro Tips

* Always pin base images (`python:3.11.4`) to avoid unexpected upgrades.
* Keep your Dockerfiles minimal. Multi-stage builds are your friend.
* Prefer Alpine images for smaller base layers—but beware of missing system libs.
* Run as non-root inside containers. `USER appuser` isn't optional.
* Use BuildKit (`DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build .`) for performance.
