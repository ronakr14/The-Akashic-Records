## 📌 Topic Overview

**SQL Server** (aka MS SQL Server) is:

* A **relational database management system (RDBMS)** developed by Microsoft.
* Designed for **OLTP, OLAP**, and **data warehousing** at enterprise scale.
* Offers built-in support for:

  * **T-SQL** (its proprietary query language)
  * **Stored procedures, views, triggers**
  * **Security (Row-Level, Always Encrypted)**
  * **Indexing and partitioning**
  * **High availability (Always On AGs, Clustering)**
  * **SSIS/SSAS/SSRS** (ETL, Analysis, Reporting)

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

* ✅ Create a DB, table, and insert data via SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
* ✅ Write JOIN queries using INNER, LEFT, and CROSS joins
* ✅ Use `EXPLAIN` or execution plan in SSMS to identify slow queries
* ✅ Create a stored procedure to process payroll for employees
* ✅ Write a trigger to audit data changes in a table
* ✅ Design and test a transaction block with rollback on error
* ✅ Backup a database to disk and restore it to a new instance
* ✅ Set permissions for read-only roles across schemas
* ✅ Deploy Always On Availability Groups in a test cluster
* ✅ Run complex reports using temporary tables and CTEs

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔹 Basic T-SQL

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM Employees WHERE department = 'Finance';
```

### 🔹 Joins

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
```

### 🔹 Stored Procedure

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_GetEmployeeByID @id INT
AS
BEGIN
  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE id = @id;
END
```

### 🔹 Transaction

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION
    UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
    UPDATE Accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
IF @@ERROR != 0
    ROLLBACK;
ELSE
    COMMIT;
```

### 🔹 Temp Table

```sql
SELECT * INTO #TempTable FROM Orders WHERE status = 'Pending';
```

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **Power BI** — Seamless reporting on top of SQL Server
* **SSIS / Azure Data Factory** — ETL + orchestration
* **Azure SQL / SQL Server on Linux / Containers** — For modern ops
* **PolyBase** — Query external data sources from SQL Server
* **Graph Extensions in SQL Server 2022+** — Model relationships natively

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use `sp_WhoIsActive` or DMVs for real-time performance monitoring
* Always define proper **index strategy** before tuning stored procs
* **Avoid scalar UDFs** in large result sets—they're perf killers
* Use **CROSS APPLY** + TVFs for elegant query chaining
* Don’t rely on `SELECT *` in production views—be explicit

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

> **SQL Server isn’t just a database. It’s a platform for orchestrating business logic, data security, analytics, and resilience.**

⚙️ Treat it like a microservice layer for data
🔐 Use RBAC, encryption, and auditing
📈 Monitor with `sys.dm_exec_query_stats`, indexes, and IO metrics
💣 Plan for HA/DR with backups + Always On
🤯 Tune queries like a Formula 1 engine
