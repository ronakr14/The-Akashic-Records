## 1. Topic Overview
SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) is Microsoft’s ETL and data integration platform.  
It allows you to extract, transform, and load data across heterogeneous systems, automate workflows, and build complex data pipelines within the Microsoft BI ecosystem.  
It’s a core tool in enterprise **data warehousing, analytics, and migration projects**.

## 2. 80/20 Roadmap
- **20% Concepts (cover 80% usage)**  
  - Understand **Control Flow vs. Data Flow**.  
  - Master **SSIS Packages, Projects, and Solutions**.  
  - Learn common **Tasks**: Execute SQL Task, Data Flow Task, Script Task.  
  - Learn common **Transformations**: Lookup, Merge Join, Derived Column, Conditional Split, Aggregate.  
  - Configure **Connections & Variables**.  
  - Deploy packages via **SSISDB (Integration Services Catalog)**.  
  - Automate with **SQL Agent Jobs**.  

- **Advanced (20% of edge cases)**  
  - Dynamic configuration with **Parameters & Expressions**.  
  - Error handling & logging strategies.  
  - Performance tuning: buffer sizes, parallel execution.  
  - Incremental load patterns (CDC, SCD, MERGE).  
  - Custom scripts with C#/VB.NET.  
  - Integration with Azure Data Factory (lift & shift).  

---

## 3. Practical Tasks
- Build your first **ETL package**: Load CSV → SQL Server table.  
- Implement **error handling** with Event Handlers.  
- Configure **package parameters** for dynamic deployment.  
- Create a **Lookup + Conditional Split** flow for data cleansing.  
- Deploy a project to **SSISDB** and run it with SQL Agent.  
- Build a **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2** flow.  
- Migrate packages to **Azure-SSIS Integration Runtime**.

## 4. Cheat Sheets

### Control Flow vs. Data Flow
- **Control Flow** = Workflow orchestration (sequence, loops, tasks).  
- **Data Flow** = Row-by-row transformations (ETL engine).  

### Common Tasks
- Execute SQL Task → Run SQL scripts.  
- Data Flow Task → Pipeline of transformations.  
- Script Task → Custom C# logic.  
- File System Task → Copy/move/delete files.  
- Send Mail Task → Notifications.  

### Common Transformations
- Derived Column → Add/modify columns.  
- Lookup → Match against reference table.  
- Conditional Split → Branch logic.  
- Merge Join → Combine datasets.  
- Aggregate → SUM, COUNT, AVG.  

### Deployment Models
- **Project Deployment Model (SSISDB)** → Recommended.  
- **Package Deployment Model** → Legacy.

## 5. Progressive Challenges
1. Create a package that loads daily sales data (CSV → SQL Server).  
2. Add error handling with **event logging** and error output flows.  
3. Parameterize the file path and connection string for reusability.  
4. Implement incremental load using **CDC** or **timestamp watermarking**.  
5. Build a data warehouse ETL: Staging → Dimensions → Facts.  
6. Optimize a large ETL package for **parallelism and memory**.  
7. Deploy to Azure-SSIS IR and orchestrate with **ADF pipelines**.

## 6. Interview Q&A
**Q1: What’s the difference between Control Flow and Data Flow?**  
Control Flow orchestrates tasks and workflows. Data Flow handles row-level transformations.  

**Q2: How do you handle incremental data loads in SSIS?**  
Options include Change Data Capture (CDC), MERGE patterns, or timestamp-based queries.  

**Q3: Explain package configurations.**  
They allow dynamic values via Parameters, Environment Variables, or Expressions at runtime.  

**Q4: What’s the difference between Project Deployment Model and Package Deployment Model?**  
Project Model uses SSISDB and is easier to manage. Package Model is legacy, file-based.  

**Q5: How do you handle error rows in Data Flow?**  
Redirect error outputs to logging tables/files for auditing.  

**Q6: How do you schedule and monitor SSIS packages?**  
Typically via SQL Server Agent Jobs, with logging to SSISDB or custom logging tables.

## 7. Next Tech Stack Recommendation
After mastering SSIS, expand to:  
- **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** → Cloud-native ETL/orchestration.  
- **Databricks** → Big data ETL & ML.  
- **Airflow / Prefect** → Open-source orchestration frameworks.  
- **dbt** → Modern transformation layer for SQL warehouses.
