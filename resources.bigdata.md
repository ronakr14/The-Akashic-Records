## 📌 Topic Overview

**Big Data** refers to handling datasets that are:

* **Too large or complex** for traditional systems.
* Characterized by the **4 Vs**:

  * **Volume** — Massive datasets
  * **Velocity** — Rapid data generation and processing
  * **Variety** — Structured, semi-structured, unstructured
  * **Veracity** — Ensuring data accuracy/reliability

**Core Pillars**:

* **Distributed Storage** (HDFS, S3, Delta Lake)
* **Distributed Processing** (Spark, Hadoop MapReduce)
* **Stream Processing** (Kafka, Flink)
* **Data Lake / Warehouse Design**
* **Scalable ETL Pipelines**
* **Cluster Resource Management** (YARN, K8s)

**Why Master It?**

* Design systems handling billions of records.
* Process real-time and batch workloads seamlessly.
* Build data lakes that power AI, analytics, and business intelligence.
