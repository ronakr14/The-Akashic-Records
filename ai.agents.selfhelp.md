## 📌 Topic Overview

**AI Agents** are autonomous or semi-autonomous software entities designed to perceive their environment, reason, make decisions, and act towards achieving specific goals. These range from simple rule-based bots to sophisticated learning systems driving robotics, virtual assistants, and complex simulations.

> Imagine AI agents as **digital problem-solvers or helpers** that observe, think, and act—often without human intervention.

They underpin a broad spectrum of applications: chatbots, recommendation systems, self-driving cars, game AI, and multi-agent simulations.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### ▶️ Basic Agent Loop (Pseudo-Python)

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, environment):
        self.env = environment

    def perceive(self):
        return self.env.get_state()

    def decide(self, state):
        # Implement decision logic or ML model here
        action = self.policy(state)
        return action

    def act(self, action):
        self.env.apply(action)

    def run(self):
        while not self.env.is_done():
            state = self.perceive()
            action = self.decide(state)
            self.act(action)
````

### ▶️ LangChain Agent Example (Python snippet)

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

tools = [Tool(name="Search", func=search_function)]
llm = OpenAI()

agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True)
response = agent.run("What is the weather in New York?")
```

## 🔍 Mental Model

> “An AI agent is a **self-driven digital entity** continuously sensing, reasoning, and acting to solve problems or assist humans — often learning and adapting over time.”

* ✅ Environment sensing is the agent’s input
* ✅ Decision logic can be rule-based or ML-powered
* ✅ Action execution changes environment state
* ✅ Agents may cooperate or compete in multi-agent systems
* ✅ External tools/APIs amplify agent capabilities
* ✅ Safety and ethics are foundational for real-world deployment
