## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **Basic API call (Python)**:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1/complete"
headers = {
    "x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
}
data = {
    "model": "claude-v1",
    "prompt": "Human: What is quantum computing?\n\nAssistant:",
    "max_tokens_to_sample": 300,
    "stop_sequences": ["\n\nHuman:"]
}
response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
print(response.json()["completion"])
```

* **Prompt structure tips**:

  * Use clear “Human:” and “Assistant:” roles.
  * Provide explicit instructions.
  * Use “stop\_sequences” to avoid run-on text.
  * Break down complex tasks step-by-step.
