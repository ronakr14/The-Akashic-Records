## 📌 Topic Overview

**PyTorch** is the darling of deep learning research and fast prototyping. It offers a **dynamic computational graph** and intuitive Pythonic interface that makes building complex neural networks feel natural and flexible.

Originally developed by Facebook’s AI Research lab, PyTorch combines the power of GPU acceleration with seamless debugging and extensibility — ideal for both experimental and production-grade models.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔢 Tensor Basics

```python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([[1., 2.], [3., 4.]])
x = x.to('cuda')  # Move to GPU
y = torch.rand(2, 2).to('cuda')
z = x + y
````

### 🏗️ Define a Model

```python
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc2(x)

model = Net().to('cuda')
```

### 🔄 Training Loop

```python
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()

for epoch in range(10):
    for inputs, labels in dataloader:
        inputs, labels = inputs.to('cuda'), labels.to('cuda')
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### 🧩 DataLoader & Dataset

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, Dataset

class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data, targets):
        self.data = data
        self.targets = targets

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx], self.targets[idx]

dataset = MyDataset(X, y)
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
```

### 🔥 Mixed Precision

```python
scaler = torch.cuda.amp.GradScaler()

for inputs, labels in dataloader:
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
```

### 💾 Save & Load

```python
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pth')
model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model.pth'))
```
