## 📌 Topic Overview

**MongoDB** is:

* A **document database** that stores data in JSON-like BSON format.
* Schema-flexible — no fixed schema means rapid iteration and easier handling of complex, nested data.
* Built for **horizontal scaling** using sharding and replica sets.
* Provides rich query language supporting **filtering, aggregation, geospatial queries, text search**.
* Includes built-in **replication** for high availability and **automatic failover**.
* Integrates with modern stacks like Node.js, Python, and cloud services.

**Why MongoDB?**

* Speedy development with dynamic schemas.
* Scales out easily across commodity hardware.
* Great for real-time analytics, content management, IoT, and user profiles.
* Built-in aggregation framework rivals traditional SQL GROUP BY.
