## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### ▶️ Load Mistral 7B via Hugging Face (Python)

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import torch

model_name = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map="auto")

prompt = "Explain the concept of blockchain in simple terms."
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
````

### ▶️ Common Fine-tuning Approach (PEFT / LoRA)

```bash
# Using PEFT library and Transformers to fine-tune lightweight adapters on Mistral
pip install peft transformers accelerate

# Example script reference:
# Apply LoRA adapters to base model and train on domain data
```
