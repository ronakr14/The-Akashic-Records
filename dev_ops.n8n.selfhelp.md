## 📌 Topic Overview

> Think of **n8n** as *Zapier for developers on steroids — a workflow automation tool that’s open-source, self-hostable, and integrates with hundreds of APIs while letting you drop into raw code whenever you need power*.

## 🚀 80/20 Roadmap

| Stage | Focus Area           | Why It Matters                                                               |
| ----- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Setup & Installation | Get n8n running locally or in Docker so you can test automations quickly.    |
| 2     | Core Concepts        | Understand nodes, workflows, triggers, and executions — the building blocks. |
| 3     | Popular Integrations | Connect Gmail, Slack, GitHub, Postgres, APIs — 80% of common use cases.      |
| 4     | Workflow Patterns    | Learn conditional logic, loops, error handling, webhooks.                    |
| 5     | Deployment           | Run it always-on via Docker, Kubernetes, or n8n.cloud.                       |
| 6     | Scaling & Ops        | Handle concurrency, secrets, logging, backups, and monitoring.               |

## 🛠️ Practical Tasks

* ✅ Install with `npm install n8n -g` or `docker run n8nio/n8n`.
* ✅ Create your first workflow: **Webhook → Function → Slack**.
* ✅ Set up **Gmail trigger** to forward emails into Notion.
* ✅ Automate **GitHub issue → JIRA ticket** workflow.
* ✅ Configure **environment variables** for secrets (don’t hardcode).
* ✅ Deploy via Docker Compose with persistent volume.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **Core CLI**

  * `n8n start` → Start locally.
  * `n8n workflow:list` → List all workflows.
  * `n8n export:workflow --id=1 --output=workflow.json` → Export workflow.
  * `n8n import:workflow --input=workflow.json` → Import workflow.

* **Key Env Vars**

  ```bash
  N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
  N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
  N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=supersecret
  N8N_PORT=5678
  N8N_PROTOCOL=https
  ```

* **Workflow Structure**

  * **Trigger Nodes**: Webhook, Cron, Email, App events.
  * **Action Nodes**: API calls, DB queries, messaging.
  * **Logic Nodes**: IF, Switch, Merge, Function, Code.

| Level           | Task                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🥉 Beginner     | Create a webhook workflow that logs request payloads to a Google Sheet.                                  |
| 🥈 Intermediate | Automate GitHub PR comments → Slack notifications.                                                       |
| 🥇 Advanced     | Build a data pipeline: API ingest → transform via Function node → store in Postgres.                     |
| 🏆 Expert       | Run a multi-tenant n8n cluster with Docker + PostgreSQL backend, add monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana. |

## 🎙️ Interview Q\&A

* **Q1:** Why use n8n instead of Zapier or Integromat?

  * n8n is open-source, self-hostable, infinitely extensible with custom code, and not limited by pricing per task. Zapier is SaaS-only and closed.

* **Q2:** How does n8n handle long-running workflows?

  * n8n stores execution state in a DB (SQLite/Postgres). Workflows can be resumed even after crashes. With queue mode + Redis, it scales horizontally.

---

## 🛣️ Next Tech Stack Recommendations

* **Temporal.io** → For enterprise-grade workflow orchestration.
* **Airflow / Prefect** → If you’re shifting from automation to heavy data pipelines.
* **Dagster** → For structured, testable data workflows.
* **Node-RED** → Simpler IoT-focused alternative to n8n.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use **Function + Function Item nodes** for light transformations (don’t overuse Code).
* Store credentials in **Credential Manager**, never inline.
* Enable **queue mode (Redis + Postgres)** before production scaling.
* Use **tags + naming conventions** for workflows so you don’t drown in spaghetti.
* Version workflows in **Git** by exporting JSON on every commit.

## 🧬 Tactical Philosophy

Automation isn’t about gluing apps together — it’s about **engineering a nervous system for your org**. n8n gives you a dev-friendly way to wire APIs, services, and data flows into a **living mesh**. Think of it as CI/CD pipelines, but for *everything* beyond code.
