## 📌 Topic Overview

**XGBoost** (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is the heavyweight champion of gradient boosting frameworks. It’s an optimized, scalable implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed, performance, and flexibility — powering countless Kaggle wins and enterprise ML pipelines alike.

XGBoost combines **gradient boosting** with **regularization**, **parallelization**, and **sparse data handling** to punch way above its weight class on structured/tabular data problems.

> ⚡ Fast and scalable  
> 🎯 Great for classification & regression  
> 🏆 Proven winning in competitions & production

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 📚 Basic Training & Prediction

```python
import xgboost as xgb

dtrain = xgb.DMatrix(X_train, label=y_train)
dtest = xgb.DMatrix(X_test)

params = {
    'objective': 'binary:logistic',
    'max_depth': 6,
    'eta': 0.1,
    'eval_metric': 'logloss',
    'verbosity': 1
}

model = xgb.train(params, dtrain, num_boost_round=100)
preds = model.predict(dtest)
````

### 🔎 Early Stopping & Eval Sets

```python
evals = [(dtrain, 'train'), (dtest, 'eval')]

model = xgb.train(
    params, dtrain, num_boost_round=500, evals=evals,
    early_stopping_rounds=20
)
```

### 🔧 Sklearn API Example

```python
from xgboost import XGBClassifier

clf = XGBClassifier(max_depth=5, n_estimators=200, learning_rate=0.05)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_test, y_test)], early_stopping_rounds=10)
predictions = clf.predict(X_test)
```

### 📊 Feature Importance

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

xgb.plot_importance(model)
plt.show()
```

### ⚡ GPU Training

```python
params['tree_method'] = 'gpu_hist'
model = xgb.train(params, dtrain, num_boost_round=200)
```
