## üìå Topic Overview

**Deep Learning (DL)** uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep architectures) to learn complex patterns. It powers:

* Image recognition (Computer Vision)
* Speech recognition
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Generative AI (ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion)

In real-world tech stacks, DL is about:

* **Tensor computations** (tensors, backpropagation)
* **Model architectures** (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
* **Training pipelines** (batches, optimizers)
* **Hardware acceleration** (GPUs/TPUs)
* **Serving models for inference at scale**
