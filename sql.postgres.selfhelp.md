## 📌 Topic Overview

**PostgreSQL** (aka Postgres) is:

* An advanced **object-relational database system**.
* Supports:

  * Full ACID compliance
  * Complex queries, joins, window functions
  * JSON/JSONB for semi-structured data
  * MVCC for concurrent reads/writes without locking
  * Extensibility (custom types, functions, operators)
  * Powerful indexing (GIN, GiST, BRIN)
* Used for OLTP, analytics, and geospatial apps (PostGIS).

**Why Postgres?**

* Open source with a huge ecosystem.
* Enterprise-grade features without licensing costs.
* Supports both relational and NoSQL-style data.
* Easy to extend and integrate with other tools.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

### 🔹 Basic Query

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE age > 30 ORDER BY name;
```

### 🔹 Join Example

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;
```

### 🔹 Window Function

```sql
SELECT employee_id, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) as salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

### 🔹 JSONB Query

```sql
SELECT data->>'name' AS name
FROM users
WHERE data @> '{"active": true}';
```

### 🔹 Create Index

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_name ON users (name);
```
