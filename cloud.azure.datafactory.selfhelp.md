## 📌 Topic Overview

**Azure Data Factory (ADF)** is:

* A fully managed **data integration & ETL service** on Azure.
* Designed for **data movement, orchestration, and transformation**.
* Key Focus Areas:

  * **Pipelines** — Workflow orchestration.
  * **Activities** — ETL tasks (Copy, Data Flow, Stored Proc, etc.).
  * **Linked Services** — Connections to data sources/destinations.
  * **Datasets** — Schema/data definitions for sources/targets.
  * **Triggers** — Time-based or event-based pipeline executions.
  * **Integration Runtime (IR)** — Compute used for data movement/transform.
  * **Mapping Data Flows** — No-code ETL transformations at scale.

**Why Master ADF?**

* It’s the backbone of Azure data engineering.
* Native connectors for **over 100+ data sources**.
* Scales seamlessly with **serverless compute**.
* Plays a key role in **modern data lakehouse architectures**.

## 🧾 Cheat Sheets

* **Create Linked Service (Blob Storage)**:

```json
{
  "name": "AzureBlobStorageLS",
  "properties": {
    "type": "AzureBlobStorage",
    "typeProperties": {
      "connectionString": "@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://kv.vault.azure.net/secrets/blobconn)"
    }
  }
}
````

* **Dataset Example (Blob CSV)**:

```json
{
  "name": "InputCSV",
  "properties": {
    "linkedServiceName": { "referenceName": "AzureBlobStorageLS", "type": "LinkedServiceReference" },
    "type": "DelimitedText",
    "typeProperties": { "location": { "type": "AzureBlobStorageLocation", "folderPath": "raw/csv" } }
  }
}
```

* **Pipeline Copy Activity (Blob → SQL)**:

```json
{
  "name": "CopyBlobToSQL",
  "properties": {
    "activities": [
      {
        "name": "CopyFromBlobToSQL",
        "type": "Copy",
        "inputs": [{ "referenceName": "InputCSV", "type": "DatasetReference" }],
        "outputs": [{ "referenceName": "SQLTableDS", "type": "DatasetReference" }],
        "typeProperties": {
          "source": { "type": "DelimitedTextSource" },
          "sink": { "type": "SqlSink" }

## ⚔️ Tactical Philosophy

**ADF is the control plane of Azure data engineering.**

Design pipelines that are:

* Modular (parameterized, reusable)
* Secure (Key Vault + Managed Identity)
* Hybrid-ready (Self-Hosted IR for on-prem)
* Scalable (Data Flows + Synapse integration)
* Automated (CI/CD + monitoring baked in)
